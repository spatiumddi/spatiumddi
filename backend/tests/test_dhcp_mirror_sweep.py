"""#620 — the orphaned-reservation-mirror sweep.

A reservation owns an ``ip_address`` row at ``status="static_dhcp"``, back-linked
by id. When a path destroys the reservation without releasing that mirror, the
address is left neither allocated nor free nor reclaimable — and invisibly so:
every release path looks the mirror up by the reservation's *current* id and
matches nothing, so no amount of clicking in the UI frees it. The paths are
fixed (#618, #620), but the failure mode is bad enough to be worth a backstop.

The sweep therefore has to be sharp in both directions: it must free provable
residue, and it must not touch anything an operator could have made by hand.
