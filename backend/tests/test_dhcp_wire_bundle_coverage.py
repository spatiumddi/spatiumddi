"""#858 — guard against a field being modelled but never shipped to the agent.

This boundary has now produced the same bug four times:

* #430 — scope ``min_lease_time`` / ``max_lease_time`` and static
  ``client_id`` / ``options_override``: settable, ETag-hashed, read by the
  agent renderer, omitted from the wire payload.
* #856 — the option-name half, on the agent's side of the same boundary.
* #858 — pool ``options_override``, ``pxe_classes`` and ``phone_classes``.
* #858 — pool ``class_restriction``, shipped but never read by the agent.

This test is why #700 wired ``device_policy_classes`` through the payload
and the agent renderer in the same change: adding the dataclass field alone
fails here.

Every occurrence is silent: the UI shows the value, the API returns it, the
ETag moves when it changes so the agent even re-syncs — and the rendered
config is identical, because the payload never carried it.

So this test asserts that every field on ``ConfigBundle`` is *consciously*
classified as either shipped to agents or deliberately withheld. Adding a
field to the dataclass fails here until someone makes that call, which is the
step all four bugs skipped.

It deliberately does NOT assert *how* a field is serialized — the wire shape
and the dataclass shape differ on purpose (the wire synthesizes a ``server``
block, scopes carry a key subset). It asserts only that the decision was made.
