"""#787 — the download handler falls back to local FS when the mirror misses.

The appliance turns the slot-image mirror on at PROMOTE (the supervisor
derives ``slotImageMirror.enabled`` from the control-plane size), so an
image staged while the box was still single-node sits on the seed's
hostPath while the mirror's PVC comes up empty. Without a fallback the
first multi-node upgrade after a promote fails on a download the operator
cannot diagnose — the bytes are right there on the node.

Two of the three ways the mirror can fail mean "it cannot answer right
now", and both fall back when this replica holds the bytes:

* **404** — the image predates the promote that enabled the mirror.
* **unreachable** — the mirror's PVC is RWO local-path, so the single pod
  is pinned to one node; losing that node would otherwise block every
  upgrade in the fleet, including the one that repairs it.

The third — a mirror that ANSWERS with an error — does **not** fall back.
It is alive and refusing or failing, most likely a mismatched
``X-Mirror-Auth`` secret, which never self-heals. Falling back there would
let nodes holding a stale local copy quietly succeed while the rest of the
fleet 502s, so the fault would surface as an inexplicably half-working
upgrade rather than an error.

Serving local bytes in the two covered cases is safe because the host
runner verifies them against the stamped sha256 and ``delete_upgrade_image``
now clears local copies too, so a deleted image cannot resurface.

Also covers the two halves that make "re-upload it" a real remedy rather
than a no-op: both ingest paths re-store when the active store has lost
the bytes, and delete cleans local FS even in mirror mode.
