"""#784 — the scope surface must not advertise a DDNS domain it cannot keep.

``ScopeResponse`` declared ``ddns_domain_override`` and ``_scope_to_response``
hardcoded it to ``None``. No column backed it, neither ``ScopeCreate`` nor
``ScopeUpdate`` declared it (so ``extra="ignore"`` dropped it from the body
without a word), and the scope form sent it on every save. An operator typed a
domain, got a 200, re-opened the scope, and found the field empty — with no
error anywhere in between.

It was removed rather than implemented. The DDNS domain is real one level up:
``services/dns/ddns.resolve_effective_ddns`` walks subnet → block → space and
reads ``ddns_domain_override`` there. A DHCP scope maps 1:1 to a subnet, so a
scope-level copy would be a second source of truth for one setting rather than
new capability.

These tests pin both halves of "removed": the response does not offer the
field, and a client still sending it (the old form, a saved script) is not
broken by it — the write succeeds and the value is simply not persisted
anywhere, which is what it always did.
