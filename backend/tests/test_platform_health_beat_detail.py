"""The beat component must not blame beat for a fault it cannot see (#925).

The detail used to read "no heartbeat — beat is stopped". That is an
assertion the check is not able to make: beat *schedules*
``app.tasks.heartbeat.beat_tick`` and a **worker** executes it, so the key
is a round trip and its absence indicts either end.

The wording had a cost. On the reported appliance beat was running
perfectly and the real fault was every worker prefork slot blocked on an
unbounded Redis connect — a state ``inspect ping`` reports as healthy,
because the MainProcess answers it without involving the pool. So the one
red component named the one process that was fine, and the investigation
went there.
