"""#773 — an agent-bound record op must carry the COMPLETE desired RRset.

A record op names one record. Every agent driver has to turn that into a
whole-RRset write, because none of the three wire protocols can express "change
this RR and leave its siblings alone": BIND9 used RFC 2136 ``replace``,
Technitium used ``overwrite=true``, PowerDNS spliced but could never retract.
So a name carrying more than one value at the same type served only whichever
op landed last — round-robin A records, a backup MX, an SPF beside a
verification TXT, multiple apex NS. The database held every value and the
agent's rendered zone file held every value; only the incremental update path
lost them, which is exactly the kind of divergence nobody notices until a
failover.

The fix stops asking the wire protocol a question it cannot answer: the control
plane already knows the whole RRset, so it stamps it onto the op and the driver
applies it as one atomic write. This file pins that stamp — the payload shape,
what it must and must not contain, and the two places it must stay absent.

What each test guards:

* the #773 repro itself — a second value at an existing name keeps the first
* delete leaves siblings alone, and an empty member list is how "drop the whole
  RRset" is expressed
* the set is scoped to (name, type), and matched case-insensitively as DNS is
* one TTL per RRset (RFC 2181), resolved from the zone default rather than a
  driver-side hardcoded 3600
* structured fields (priority / weight / port) ride along, or a two-member MX
  loses the distinction between primary and backup
* every op in a batch carries the same set, which is what makes a batch
  order-independent and an op replay-safe
* DNSSEC ops carry no RRset (they have no record to reason about) and must not
  blow up on the way past
* agentless drivers ARE stamped too (#783), and the change handed to the
  driver carries the set as a neutral ``RRsetData``
