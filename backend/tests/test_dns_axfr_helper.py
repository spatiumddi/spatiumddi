"""Regression tests for the shared AXFR helper (``app.drivers.dns._axfr``).

This module had no coverage at all, which is how it shipped a bug that made
every hostname-addressed AXFR fail 100% of the time: ``dns.query.xfr`` takes
an IP *literal* and calls ``dns.inet.af_for_address()`` on it up front, so a
``DNSServer.host`` like ``"dns-bind9"`` raised a bare, message-less
``ValueError`` before a single packet was sent. The #61 drift report and the
pull-importer both surfaced that empty string as the failure reason, so the
symptom was "failed, no reason given" on every BIND9 server.

The tests below pin both halves of the fix: names get resolved before the
transfer, and no failure path is ever allowed to produce a blank message.
