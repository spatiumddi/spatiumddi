"""``ENCRYPTED_COLUMNS`` must match the schema exactly (#781).

The cross-install rewrap is what makes a restore onto a different install
work: every Fernet-encrypted column is decrypted with the source install's
key and re-encrypted with the destination's. A column missing from that
list is silently skipped — the restore reports success and the value stays
encrypted under a key the destination does not have. First use throws
``InvalidToken``, and once the source box is gone the key exists only
inside a `secrets.enc` the operator has probably discarded.

That is not a hypothetical: on the appliance, ``spatiumddi-firstboot``
mints a fresh ``SECRET_KEY`` on every install, so EVERY restore onto
reimaged hardware is a cross-install restore.

The list is deliberately hand-maintained so that adding an encrypted
column is a review decision. This test is what makes that safe — without
it the list drifted to 21 of 47 columns and named a table
(``tailscale_target``) that has never existed, whose lookup failure the
``UndefinedTableError`` handler swallowed silently.
