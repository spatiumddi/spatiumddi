"""#632 — soft-deleting a DNS zone/record must retract it from agentless
providers (Cloudflare / Route 53 / Azure / Google / Windows DNS), and the
30-day purge must not orphan it.

Agent-based BIND9 / PowerDNS converge by dropping the row from the next
ConfigBundle render; agentless drivers have no bundle, so the control plane must
push the retraction explicitly. Before #632 the singular soft-delete path
skipped that push (only the permanent / bulk paths did it), and the purge Core-
DELETE removed the DB row with no push at all — leaving a live record/zone the
platform had no remaining knowledge of (a subdomain-takeover vector once the IP
is reclaimed).

Covers:
  * records — soft-delete pushes ``delete`` to an agentless primary
  * records — restore re-pushes ``create`` (the inverse must move together)
  * records — an agent-based soft-delete still enqueues its delete op
  * zones   — soft-delete does NOT tear the hosted zone down (zone-ID / NS churn
              on restore), and restore does NOT re-push its cascade records
  * purge   — a soft-deleted agentless zone is torn down before its row is
              removed, and is LEFT in place (retry next sweep) if the push fails
  * purge   — a pre-#632 agentless record is retracted before its row is removed
  * purge   — records inside a zone being purged, and agent-based records, are
              skipped (the zone teardown / bundle already cover them)
