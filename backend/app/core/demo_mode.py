"""Demo mode — locks down abusable mutation surfaces.

Enabled via the ``DEMO_MODE=1`` env var (see ``Settings.demo_mode``).
Used by the GitHub Codespaces public-demo deployment to keep the
instance from being weaponised as a scanner / SSRF springboard /
mail relay by anonymous visitors.

What demo mode does:

1. At startup, force a curated set of feature modules off and reject
   PATCH attempts to re-enable them (``DEMO_RESTRICTED_MODULES``).
2. Returns 403 from selected mutation endpoints (factory reset,
   password change, AI provider / webhook / audit-forward / backup
   target / SMTP create + integration target creates). Each gated
   handler imports ``forbid_in_demo_mode`` and calls it inline.
3. Surfaces a ``demo_mode`` flag through ``/health/platform`` so the
   frontend can show a persistent banner.

What demo mode does NOT do:

* Block reads — every list / detail / search endpoint stays open.
* Block IPAM / DNS / DHCP CRUD on the seeded demo data — visitors
  should be able to play with it. The threat model is "anonymous
  demo viewers can't weaponise this", not "everything is read-only".
* Restrict outbound network at the OS layer. Codespaces doesn't
  support that cleanly; mitigation is at the application layer.
