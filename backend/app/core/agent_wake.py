"""Redis pub/sub "wake" for the agent ``/config`` long-polls (#358).

The DNS and DHCP agents hold an HTTP long-poll open on ``/config``; the
api handler re-builds the ConfigBundle from the DB on a fixed tick and
returns the moment the ETag shifts. Historically that tick was a blind
``asyncio.sleep(2)`` re-poll, so every parked agent forced ~15 bundle
rebuilds per 30 s window even when nothing changed, and a real change
took up to one tick to surface.

This module lets a mutating request *wake* the parked long-poll the
instant its change commits, collapsing both the latency and the idle
re-poll cost — **without** Redis ever becoming the sole delivery path
(non-negotiable #5):

* ``publish_wake`` is fire-and-forget. Any Redis error is swallowed +
  logged; it never propagates into the mutating request (a Redis
  outage must not 500 a CRUD write).
* ``wake_subscription`` / ``WakeSubscription.wait`` degrade to a plain
  ``asyncio.sleep`` on **any** Redis error, so a Redis-down deployment
  behaves byte-for-byte like the old fixed-tick poll.
* The ETag / pending-ops compare in the long-poll stays the sole
  source of truth. A wake is purely advisory ("re-check now"): a
  spurious wake costs one no-op rebuild, a missed wake is caught by
  the ``WAKE_TICK_SECONDS`` belt-and-braces tick or the next deadline.

Cross-process safe: every api replica subscribes to the channels for
the agents whose long-polls it is holding; a mutation committed on any
replica (or a Celery worker — those publish over ``settings.redis_url``
explicitly) fans out to all subscribers via the Redis master, so the
woken poll re-reads committed state regardless of which replica holds
it. Reuses the Sentinel-aware ``make_async_redis`` so it follows
failover in an HA deployment.

# Belt-and-braces re-poll tick when Redis is healthy: even if some

# Now that the config-affecting mutation sites publish wakes (#358
# Phase 0a record chokepoint + 0b DHCP / DNS-structural / host-config /
# worker / import / resize publishers), the common case converges via

# the historical 2 s to 12 s — banking ~6x fewer idle ConfigBundle
# rebuilds per parked agent. A genuinely missed publisher degrades to
