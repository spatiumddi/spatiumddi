"""Typed ``Response`` subclasses so a non-JSON route documents itself (#921).

FastAPI derives a route's documented success media type from its
``response_class``, and the default is ``JSONResponse``. A handler annotated
``-> Response`` that streams a zip therefore publishes ``application/json``,
which a generated client cannot decode and a strict validator rejects.

Adding ``responses={200: {"content": {"application/zip": {}}}}`` — the shape
#861 used for the ``export.pdf`` routes — **merges** with that default rather
than replacing it, so the route ends up declaring BOTH. That silences the
conformance failure (the served type is now documented) while still telling a
generator the endpoint might return JSON, which it never does.

Setting ``response_class`` is what replaces it. It has to be a subclass that
declares ``media_type``: the bare ``Response`` and ``StreamingResponse``
classes leave it ``None``, and FastAPI then documents *no* content at all —
worse than the JSON it was meant to correct.

These change documentation only. Every handler using them returns an explicit
``Response`` it built itself, so ``response_class`` never touches the wire.
Keep the class's ``media_type`` and the handler's ``media_type=`` the same —
``tests/test_response_media_types.py`` compares exactly those two.
