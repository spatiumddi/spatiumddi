"""Make the published OpenAPI document consumable by code generators (#907).

FastAPI is a faithful OpenAPI 3.1 emitter, and 3.1 spells "nullable" as a
union with the JSON Schema ``null`` type::

    "feed_url": {"anyOf": [{"type": "string"}, {"type": "null"}], "title": "Feed Url"}

Strict generators do not all implement that arm. ``swift-openapi-generator``
skips the member it cannot model — and skipping a member drops **the whole
property** from the generated type, with a warning rather than an error. On
this document that silently removed 3,291 schema properties and 297 query
parameters from a client generated against a running control plane: models
missing a third of their fields, and ``limit`` gone from list endpoints, so the
client could not paginate at all. A client that compiles, passes review, and is
quietly incomplete is precisely the drift a generated client exists to prevent.

So the document states nullability the other way round — the way every
generator already handles, and the way JSON Schema described optional fields
before 3.1: the plain schema, with the property absent from ``required``::

    "feed_url": {"type": "string", "title": "Feed Url"}

**What this trades away.** The server still *sends* ``"feed_url": null`` rather
than omitting the key, so a strict response validator (schemathesis, and our
own live conformance fuzz) now sees an explicit null against a schema that no
longer admits one. That is a real, deliberate cost, taken because the
alternative — dropping ``null`` from responses via ``exclude_none`` — changes
the wire for every existing client of this API, and because the generated-code
failure is silent while the validator complaint is not. On the decode side
nothing is lost: an absent key and an explicit null both land as ``nil`` /
``undefined`` in every generator's optional-property handling.

**Request bodies keep their ``required``.** Moving nullability onto ``required``
is right for a response — an absent key and a null both decode to nil — and
wrong for a request, where ``required`` is not a hint but what the server
enforces: a field annotated ``X | None`` with no default is a key pydantic
demands, and a generated client that believed the document and omitted it
would get a 422 back. So the rewrite below collapses the union everywhere (a
dropped property is unusable in either direction) but leaves ``required``
alone on any schema reachable from a ``requestBody``. A schema used in both
directions keeps it too: telling a client it may omit a key the server rejects
is the worse of the two failures, and the real fix for one of those is to give
the field a default so it is honestly optional.

The union still collapses on the way in, so a generated client cannot send an
explicit ``null`` to clear a field — but it could not before either, because
the property it would have sent was dropped from the request model entirely.
Clearing through such a client goes through whatever the endpoint's own
convention is; being able to set the field at all is the step forward.

Applied to the served document (``app.openapi()``), so ``/api/openapi.json``,
``/api/docs`` and the release artifact ``scripts/export_openapi.py`` publishes
all say the same thing — a client generated against a running server and one
generated from the pinned release asset must not disagree.
