"""Group/role-based permission checks.

The shape of a permission stored in `Role.permissions` (JSONB) is::

    {"action": "<action>", "resource_type": "<resource_type>", "resource_id": "<uuid?>"}

- ``action``: ``read``, ``write``, ``delete``, ``admin`` (``admin`` implies
  the other three on that resource_type), or the wildcard ``"*"``.
- ``resource_type``: one of the strings enumerated in ``docs/PERMISSIONS.md``
  (e.g. ``ip_space``, ``dns_zone``), or the wildcard ``"*"``.
- ``resource_id``: optional. When absent/None the permission applies to every
  instance of ``resource_type``; when set it scopes to that single UUID.

Superadmin (`User.is_superadmin=True`) short-circuits every check and is never
denied. This is enforced both here and in the FastAPI dependency factories.

Two entry points are exported:

* ``user_has_permission`` — pure helper, safe to call from inside a handler
  after a DB lookup (fine-grained, per-row gate).
* ``require_permission`` — dependency factory for FastAPI. Pass it into
  ``Depends(...)`` / ``dependencies=[Depends(...)]`` at route or router scope.
