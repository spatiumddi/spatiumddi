"""Classify a Postgres integrity error as the CLIENT's fault or OURS (#922).

``POST /dhcp/servers`` with a well-formed but nonexistent ``server_group_id``
answered an unhandled 500: #861's global handler maps unique violations
(23505) to 409 and deliberately re-raises everything else, on the reasoning
that a NOT NULL / foreign-key / CHECK violation means the server sent
something it shouldn't and a 4xx would both blame the client and *hide* the
bug from the conformance fuzz's no-5xx assertion.

That reasoning is right about the general case and wrong about one arm of it.
A foreign-key violation on a value **the client supplied** — a stale group id
in a request body — is an ordinary client error; a foreign-key violation on a
value the *server* computed is exactly the bug #861 wanted to keep visible.
The constraint alone cannot tell those apart, so this module uses the
discriminator that can: Postgres names the offending column and value in the
error's ``DETAIL``, and we answer 4xx only when that value is one the request
actually carried.

Everything else — including a foreign-key violation whose value appears
nowhere in the request — re-raises to the 500 path unchanged, so the class of
bug #861 was protecting stays as loud as it was.
