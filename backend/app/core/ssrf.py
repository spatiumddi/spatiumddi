"""Defense-in-depth SSRF guard for operator-supplied integration targets.

SECURITY (#400 / GHSA-mj4g-hw3m-62rm, finding L5):
    The integration "Test Connection" endpoints (kubernetes / docker /
    proxmox / unifi / opnsense / tailscale / cloud / dns-import) take an
    operator-supplied host / URL and have the *server* open a connection
    to it. That is a server-side request — an authenticated SSRF surface.
    Because reaching these endpoints already requires the
    integration-write resource permission (or superadmin), the blast
    radius is small, so this is a LOW / defense-in-depth control rather
    than a primary fix.

    The honest constraint here is that almost every one of these
    integrations *legitimately* points at an RFC1918 LAN host — a
    Proxmox box on ``192.168.x.x``, a UniFi controller on ``10.x``, a
    docker daemon at ``unix:///var/run/docker.sock`` or a LAN TLS
    endpoint. We therefore MUST NOT blanket-block private ranges; doing
    so would break the product's core on-prem use case.

    What we *can* safely flag is the classic SSRF pivot targets that no
    legitimate integration target should ever resolve to:

        * loopback         127.0.0.0/8, ::1
        * link-local       169.254.0.0/16, fe80::/10
        * cloud metadata   169.254.169.254 (a link-local address; called
                           out explicitly because it is the canonical
                           SSRF-to-cloud-creds pivot)

    ``assert_safe_target`` resolves the host and, by default, *logs* the
    resolved IP plus a ``ssrf_guard_*`` structured event so an operator
    grepping the audit/log trail can see exactly what the control plane
    was asked to dial. Loopback / link-local / metadata resolutions are
    logged at WARNING. Hard blocking is opt-in (``block=True``) and is
    deliberately NOT used by the on-box-capable integrations, because a
    full-stack appliance can legitimately reach a service on
    ``127.0.0.1`` (e.g. a co-located daemon) and we will not break that.

This module is intentionally dependency-light (stdlib ``ipaddress`` +
``socket`` + ``structlog``) and has no import-time side effects.
