"""Embedded ACME *client* models (issue #438 Phase 1).

Distinct from ``app.models.acme`` — that module is the ACME *provider*
side (an acme-dns-compatible HTTP surface external clients use to prove
control of a SpatiumDDI-hosted FQDN). The two models here are the
*client* side: SpatiumDDI itself acting as an ACME client against a
public CA (Let's Encrypt), driving the RFC 8555 DNS-01 flow to issue a
CA-trusted TLS cert for the appliance Web UI.

Two persistence surfaces:

* ``ACMEClientAccount`` — the operator's ACME account at the CA. One
  account key (Fernet-encrypted) + the CA-assigned account URL. At
  most one account is expected per install in Phase 1, but the table
  doesn't enforce that — the orchestrator picks the most-recent row.
  External Account Binding (EAB) fields are present for CAs that
  require it (ZeroSSL, some private CAs); Let's Encrypt does not.
* ``ACMEOrder`` — one row per issuance attempt. Carries the requested
  domains + challenge type + the CA's order/finalize URLs + a status
  the orchestrator walks (pending → processing → valid|invalid). On
  success ``certificate_id`` points at the ``ApplianceCertificate`` row
  the issued chain landed in.

The issued cert flows into the EXISTING ``ApplianceCertificate``
storage + deploy path with ``source="letsencrypt"`` — there is no
separate cert table here.
