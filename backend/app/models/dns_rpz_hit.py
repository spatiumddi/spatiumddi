"""RPZ policy-hit attribution (issue #699).

SpatiumDDI serves curated blocklists as RPZ zones and, until this
existed, threw every hit away. That made the most operationally useful
question the blocklists can answer — *which machine keeps reaching for
blocked domains* — unanswerable. A blocked lookup is not a problem; a
host generating thousands of them is an infected host announcing
itself.

One row per policy rewrite, written by the query-log ingest when the
line came from named's ``rpz`` logging category. Deliberately a
separate table from ``dns_query_log_entry`` rather than a flag on it:

* RPZ hits are worth keeping far longer than raw queries. The query log
  is 24 h operator triage; "this host has hit the malware feed every
  day this week" needs to outlive that, exactly like the threat rollup
  does.
* The columns genuinely differ — a hit carries a policy action, a
  trigger type and the feed that matched, none of which a query has.
* Mixing them would make the query log's own retention sweep either
  drop the hits early or keep the queries too long.

``rpz_zone`` records which RPZ zone matched. Note the resolution limit:
``dns/agent_config.py`` merges every enabled blocklist into ONE rendered
zone per view, so for SpatiumDDI-managed lists this distinguishes
*views*, not individual feeds — "which of my 14 lists fired" needs
either per-list zones or a qname join back to ``DNSBlockListEntry``, and
is follow-up work on #699. It does separate our zone from any
hand-rolled ``response-policy`` zone an operator runs alongside.
