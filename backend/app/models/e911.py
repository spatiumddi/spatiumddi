"""E911 dispatchable location — issue #972 Phase 1 (LIS core).

RAY BAUM'S Act §506 (47 CFR §9.16(b)) requires every MLTS 911 call to
carry a **dispatchable location**: a validated civic address *plus*
"additional information such as room number, floor number, or similar
information necessary to adequately identify the location of the calling
party". Fixed devices since Jan 2021, non-fixed since Jan 2022. The duty
is on the **enterprise**, not the carrier.

SpatiumDDI already holds every raw input needed to answer "which room is
this device in, right now?" and nothing joins them — DHCP leases and
``IpMacHistory`` for IP↔MAC, ``NetworkFdbEntry`` for MAC↔switch-port,
``NetworkNeighbour`` for the phone's own LLDP announcement,
``Subnet.site_id`` / ``NetworkDevice.site_id`` for the building. That is
exactly the tracking Cisco Emergency Responder does with its own SNMP
pollers against the same switches; here it is a by-product of data
collected for IPAM, and every other consumer can read it too.

**We are not the 911 service provider.** No call routing, no ALI upload,
no ELIN provisioning, no PSAP interaction. This is a location *source*;
the operator's legal duty under §9.16 is theirs, and the docs say so
rather than implying "install this and you are compliant".

Three structural decisions worth stating outright:

* **The civic address lives here, not on ``Site``.** ``Site`` carries
  ``name`` / ``code`` / ``kind`` / ``region`` / ``parent_site_id`` and no
  address fields at all, so there was nothing to extend. An ERL is also
  finer-grained than a site by construction — a building has many
  dispatchable locations — so even a Site with an address could only ever
  supply the front door.

* **Every civic element is its own column**, not one JSONB blob or one
  free-text string. A string cannot be decomposed later, and PIDF-LO,
  HELD and every provider validation API want the elements separately.
  JSONB was the other candidate and is specifically wrong here: #917
  established that an unconstrained object publishes as
  ``{"type": "object"}`` with no properties, which a code generator
  cannot use — and the civic address is the one field every external
  consumer of this feature reads. ``CIVIC_ELEMENTS`` below is the single
  source of truth for the column set, its CAtype numbers and its PIDF-LO
  tag names, so the Phase 2 renderer and the CSV export cannot drift
  from the schema the way the two blocklist renderers did in #878.

* **Binding precedence is fixed in code, not operator-ordered.** There is
  no ``priority`` column: ``ERL_RULE_PRECEDENCE`` is a constant and
  most-specific always wins. An operator who could reorder these could
  put ``site_default`` above ``switch_port`` and send every ambulance to
  the front door while the UI showed a rule for the room. One ERL per
  target per kind is enforced by UNIQUE constraints for the same reason:
  a tie would otherwise be resolved by whichever row the planner
  happened to return.

``ip_address_id`` and ``network_interface_id`` are ``ON DELETE CASCADE``
on the binding only — deleting the *binding* never touches the ERL, and
deleting an ERL drops its bindings, which fails safe: the resolver then
degrades to the next-coarser rule instead of pointing at a location that
no longer exists.
