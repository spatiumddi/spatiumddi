"""DICOM Application Entity registry — issue #723 (part of #543).

A DICOM Application Entity Title is a flat, **institution-wide-unique**,
16-byte identifier. Every imaging device, PACS node, workstation and
archive on a hospital network answers to one, and every peer that wants
to talk to it must have that exact string configured. Duplicates break
C-MOVE, Storage Commitment, Modality Worklist and MPPS in ways that are
famously hard to trace, and the failure mode is documented back to 1997.

DICOM PS3.15 Annex H defines ``dicomUniqueAETitlesRegistryRoot`` — an LDAP
registry object whose entire purpose is allocating unique AE Titles via a
compare-and-set against an enforced constraint. It is essentially
undeployed. In practice the namespace lives in a spreadsheet.

That is the BACnet device-instance argument (#541,
``uq_bacnet_device_instance``) with better provenance: the standard
itself says the value must be unique and specifies a registry for it, and
no incumbent system owns the namespace. So the ``UNIQUE(ae_title)``
constraint below is the point of this table, not an incidental index.

Two structural decisions worth stating outright:

* ``ip_address_id`` is **nullable** with ``ON DELETE SET NULL``, unlike
  BACnet's ``CASCADE``. An AE Title outlives the host it currently runs
  on: it is burned into peer configuration across the estate, so
  decommissioning an IP must demote the title to a *reservation*, not
  free a name that a dozen modalities still send to. Cascading would
  hand that name straight back to the next commissioning engineer.
* ``DICOMPeer`` is a directed AE→AE edge describing *configured*
  associations, not observed traffic. It is what makes "what breaks if I
  renumber this host" and an ePHI data-flow map answerable — the
  topology-rule analogue of BACnet's BBMD-per-subnet.

**No PHI, ever.** This registry stores network identity only: titles,
addresses, ports, roles, vendors. It records nothing about patients,
studies, or images. Storing patient-identifiable data would make
SpatiumDDI a HIPAA Business Associate, which is permanently out of
scope. There is deliberately no free-text field documented as safe for
clinical detail, and ``notes`` is documented in the API as
network-configuration notes.

Phase 1 (this) is registry + conformity with zero network I/O. The
C-ECHO verification probe — which would confirm an AE actually answers
at the recorded host:port — is deferred to its own issue. Unlike every
other deferred probe in the #543 family it is *not* blocked on the
agent↔subnet binding (C-ECHO is routable unicast TCP), but it must
respect the #722 do-not-probe flag, and a probe that reaches a modality
mid-study is exactly the hazard #722 exists for.
