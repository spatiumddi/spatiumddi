"""The HELD endpoint — RFC 5985 (#972 Phase 1b).

``POST /held`` with ``application/held+xml``, returning PIDF-LO. Mounted at
the application root rather than under ``/api/v1`` because a HELD client is
configured with a whole URL and the protocol names this path; the ACME
``.well-known`` route is mounted the same way for the same reason.

**Authenticated like any other API surface.** A third-party caller — a
PBX, Cisco Emergency Responder, RedSky — uses an API token scoped to
``/held`` with the ``e911_location`` read permission. The unauthenticated
device-self-query mode RFC 5985 §6 describes is Phase 2 and is off by
default (see ``E911_SELF_QUERY_ENABLED``), because an unauthenticated
endpoint that answers "where is the device at this IP" is one an attacker
inside the network can walk.

**A request with no identity is REFUSED while self-query is off.** That is
the load-bearing refusal on this surface: RFC 5985's default is to answer
from the requester's own address, so falling through would hand a PBX the
location of *its own server* in response to a question about a phone —
a perfectly-formed answer that is completely wrong, which is worse than an
error. The Phase 2 self-query path is opt-in precisely so that behaviour
is never reached by accident.

Every answer writes an ``e911_resolution_log`` row, exactly as the JSON
lookup does. The protocol is different; the fact that somebody asked where
a person sits is not.
