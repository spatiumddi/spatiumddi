"""Running-version + release-check endpoint.

Public (no auth) because the sidebar renders before login and the
release-check banner is visible even on the login screen. The response
is tiny and cacheable; no sensitive data leaks beyond the version
string itself — which is also stamped on every Docker image's OCI
label anyway.

SECURITY (#400 / L6): the appliance-specific fields
(``appliance_version`` / ``appliance_hostname``) DO leak operational
detail — most notably the host's configured hostname — so they are
withheld from unauthenticated callers. The endpoint stays public for
the bare ``version`` + release-check banner; appliance fields populate
only when a valid Bearer credential is presented.
