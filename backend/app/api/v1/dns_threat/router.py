"""DNS threat analytics read surface (issue #699).

Read-mostly: the detections write themselves via the rollup task. The
one mutation is the per-client mute (operator triage), which carries a
``write`` permission gate of its own because suppressing a critical
security finding must not be something a read-only account can do.
Gated behind the default-off
``security.dns_threat`` feature module at the router include, so the
whole prefix 404s on installs that haven't opted in.

Gated on ``read:server`` at the router, matching the Logs surface it
summarises — anyone trusted to read raw queries is trusted to read a
rollup of them.
