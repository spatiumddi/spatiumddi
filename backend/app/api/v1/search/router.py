    - CIDR (``10.0.0.0/24``) → subnets and blocks within that range.

    Results are ranked by match quality (exact > prefix > substring) before
    the per-type limit is applied, then re-ranked across types, so an exact
    hit cannot be crowded out by weak matches from a type queried earlier.

    Every type is filtered against the caller's own ``read`` permission and
