"""Time-series read endpoints for the built-in dashboard.

Two symmetric endpoints — ``/metrics/dns/timeseries`` and
``/metrics/dhcp/timeseries`` — return bucketed per-server counter
deltas over a requested time window. The backing rows are written by
the agents (see `app.api.v1.{dns,dhcp}.agents.agent_metrics`); this
module is read-only.

Window → bucket selection is auto-scaled so charts stay readable:
short windows (< 24 h) return raw 60 s rows, 24 h and longer aggregate
server-side into 5 min buckets. The ceiling is the chart's pixel width,
not a row budget — 24 h of raw 60 s rows is 1,440 points into a
~1,300 px plot, i.e. more points than pixels, which paints a jittery
low-rate series as a solid filled band rather than a line. At 300 s
that window is 288 points and legible; 7 d is 2,016.
