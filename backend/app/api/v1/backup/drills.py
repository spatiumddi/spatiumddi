"""Restore-verification drill endpoints (issue #702).

Mounted at ``/backup/drills`` by the parent backup router. All
gated to superadmin, matching the rest of the backup surface: a
drill result names the destination and the archive, which is the
same class of metadata the targets endpoints protect.

Drills are read-mostly — the schedule itself lives on the backup
target (``drill_enabled`` / ``drill_cron``, set through
``PATCH /backup/targets/{id}``), so the only mutation here is the
manual "run one now" kick.
