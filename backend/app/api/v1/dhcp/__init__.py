"""DHCP API router aggregation.

``agents.router`` is deliberately NOT included here (#1068). It is
mounted separately at the v1 level, under the same ``/dhcp`` prefix so
the wire path is unchanged, because this router carries the
``core.dhcp`` gate and ``require_module`` answers **404** — the one
status that makes a DHCP agent discard its JWT and re-bootstrap from the
PSK ("Agent bootstrap + reconnection" in CLAUDE.md). Gating the agent
long-poll would not disable a fleet, it would put every live Kea agent
into a re-bootstrap loop against a surface that keeps saying 404.

It keeps ``wake_publishing`` at that mount point, because
``/dhcp/agents/lease-events`` drives subnet DDNS and so does enqueue
record ops.

The DNS side has always had this shape; only DHCP nested its agent
router, which is why this file changed and ``dns/__init__.py`` did not.
