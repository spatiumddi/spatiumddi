"""SpatiumDDI release management — Phase 4c.

Mounted at ``/api/v1/appliance/releases``. Read-only:
    GET / — list available releases + currently-installed version.

#294 — the old ``POST /apply`` + ``GET /log`` endpoints were removed.
They drove a pre-#183 docker-compose update (a trigger file watched by
a host-side ``spatiumddi-update.path`` unit running
``docker-compose pull && up -d``), which does nothing on the k3s
appliance — no compose stack, no such unit. OS upgrades on the
appliance go through the A/B slot image flow (``slot.py`` /
``services/appliance/slot.py``, surfaced on the Fleet tab); docker/k8s
control planes run the manual ``docker compose`` / ``helm upgrade``
commands the UI shows.
