"""Appliance management — Phase 4 root router.

Phase 4a landed visibility gating + ``/info``. Sub-phases attach their
endpoints by including a sub-router into this APIRouter — keeps each
surface (TLS / releases / containers / etc.) in its own file but they
all share the same ``/api/v1/appliance`` prefix + permission gate.

Gating model:

* ``settings.appliance_mode`` — set by the appliance compose env. On
  non-appliance deploys the router stays mounted but ``/info`` reports
  ``appliance_mode=false`` and the frontend hides the sidebar entry.
* ``require_permission("read", "appliance")`` — RBAC gate. The
  "Appliance Operator" builtin role grants ``admin``; superadmin
  always bypasses. Layered on top of ``appliance_mode`` so a deploy
  on plain docker-compose can't smuggle out appliance-only data via
  a stolen non-superadmin token.
