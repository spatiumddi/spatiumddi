"""DNS driver registry.

Per CLAUDE.md non-negotiable #10, the service layer obtains a driver via
``get_driver(server_type)`` and speaks only to the abstract interface.

SpatiumDDI ships five authoritative DNS drivers: BIND9 (default), PowerDNS
(issue #127, Phase 1 — agent-managed alongside BIND9), Technitium
(agent-managed, REST-API driven), Technitium over its remote API (issue
#810 — agentless, for a server the operator already runs), and Windows DNS
(WinRM-driven, agentless). New drivers register here without touching the
service layer.
