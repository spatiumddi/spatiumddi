"""Self-service request submit path (issue #696).

This module owns exactly one thing the #62 approval spine did not already do:
turning a *requester's* form submission into a pending row. Everything after
that — the FOR UPDATE state guard, the self-approval block, the approver's
permission checks, the re-preview stale guard, ``apply()`` under the
approver's identity, the audit rows, the expiry sweep — is
``services.approvals.service`` unchanged. #696 explicitly asks not to grow a
second state machine, and this is how that promise is kept.

The one asymmetry worth naming: the submit path does **not** require the
caller to hold the operation's ``required_permission``. That inverts #62,
where the requester was a permitted operator whose action got intercepted.
Here the requester is by definition someone who cannot do the thing — that is
what makes it a request. The permission is enforced on the *approver* instead,
by the shared spine, which is where it belongs. The blast radius of that
inversion is bounded by the catalog allow-list (see ``catalog.py``).
