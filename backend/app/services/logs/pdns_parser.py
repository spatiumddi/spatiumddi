"""PowerDNS Authoritative query-log line parser.

PowerDNS writes one stderr line per incoming query when both
``log-dns-queries=yes`` and ``log-dns-details=yes`` are set in
``pdns.conf``. The agent's stderr capture redirects that output
into ``/var/log/pdns/pdns.log`` and the QueryLogShipper tails the
file. This parser converts each line into the same
:class:`~app.services.logs.bind9_parser.ParsedQueryLine` shape so
the ingest endpoint can dispatch by ``server.driver`` without the
storage layer caring which DNS daemon emitted the line.

Sample line shapes pdns 4.9 emits::

    May 08 02:11:22 Remote 192.0.2.5:54321 wants 'www.example.com|A', do = 0, bufsize = 4096: 1 RR(s)
    May 08 02:11:22 Remote 127.0.0.1:54321 wants 'foo.example.com|AAAA', do = 1, bufsize = 4096: packetcache HIT

PowerDNS does not stamp a year on its timestamps (it uses syslog-
style ``Month DD HH:MM:SS`` derived from the C runtime). We treat
the line as occurring in the current UTC year — if a line crosses
into a new year while the agent is mid-batch, we may stamp it with
the wrong year by ~1 day. That's the same approximation the syslog
collector ecosystem makes; for query logs (24h retention) it's
inconsequential.

Lines that the regex can't match still come back as a
``ParsedQueryLine`` with most fields ``None`` and the raw text
preserved, so the operator can still see "something happened" in
the UI.

#
# Implementation history (CodeQL ``py/polynomial-redos`` alerts #40
# + #41):
#
# * Alert #40 — the original one-shot ``re.search`` pattern combined
#   a greedy ``[^\]]+``, an alternation fallback, and a lazy
#   ``[0-9a-fA-F.:]+?`` — polynomial-time backtracking on inputs
#   shaped like ``Remote [\\\\…\\\\``. Fixed by switching to a
#   split-on-hard-separator structure.
#
# * Alert #41 — the *separator regex* itself
#   (``r"\s+wants\s+'"``) had two ``\s+`` quantifiers around a
#   literal token. On adversarial input with many leading+trailing
#   spaces the two ``\s+`` groups can split a whitespace run in
#   O(n²) ways before the trailing ``'`` mismatch finally fails.
#   Fix: drop the regex entirely. Real pdns log lines always have a
#   single literal space around ``wants`` (the daemon's format
#   string is ``"Remote %s wants '%s|%s'"`` — see pdns 4.9 source),
#   so ``str.split(" wants '", 1)`` is exact, fast, and trivially
#   linear in the string length. Same fix the bind9 parser landed
#   for alerts #16 + #18.
