"""BIND9 query log line parser.

A typical BIND9 query log line looks like::

    25-Apr-2026 16:30:01.123 client @0x7f... 192.0.2.5#54321 (example.com): query: example.com IN A +E(0)K (10.0.0.1)

The leading timestamp is present when the channel sets
``print-time yes`` (we always render it that way — see
``backend/app/drivers/dns/templates/bind9/named.conf.j2``). The
``client @0x... <ip>#<port>`` block carries the resolver address and
the ephemeral source port; ``(<question>):`` is BIND's polite echo
of the query name. The ``query:`` body itself follows: ``<qname>
<qclass> <qtype> <flags>``. The trailing ``(<server>)`` is the
listening interface BIND received the query on (often the host's
LAN address) and is mostly noise for the UI.

This parser is deliberately liberal — every regex group is optional
because BIND configurations vary (no ``print-time``, no
``print-category``, IPv6 clients, view names, etc). When a field
can't be extracted we leave it as ``None`` and the caller stores the
raw line untouched.
