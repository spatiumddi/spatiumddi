"""Self-signed cert bootstrap — Phase 4b.5 (issue #134).

Runs on appliance api startup, and settles on ONE active
``appliance_certificate`` row by trying three things in order:

1. **An active row already exists** (operator-uploaded, CSR-signed, or
   a previous bootstrap) — re-deploy it to the TLS Secret. Handles the
   case where the Secret was wiped (fresh upgrade, factory reset) but
   the DB row survived. nginx then reloads via the deployer.

2. **No active row, but the TLS Secret already holds a usable cert** —
   adopt it (#767). On a fresh appliance, firstboot mints a self-signed
   cert into ``spatium-appliance-tls`` via a k3s auto-deploy manifest
   *before* the chart bootstraps, so the frontend nginx has been serving
   it since its first request. Adopting records it as the active row and
   deploys nothing: the Secret is already correct, the frontend must not
   roll, and the operator must not be asked to trust a second cert
   halfway through a boot they are watching.

3. **Neither** — generate a self-signed cert valid 5 years with the
   appliance's hostname + every detected non-loopback IP as SANs, insert
   it ``source=self-signed`` + ``is_active=true``, and deploy it so nginx
   has something to serve.
