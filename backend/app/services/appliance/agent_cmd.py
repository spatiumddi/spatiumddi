"""Generalized command channel — control plane → Fleet appliance.

This is a direct generalization of
:mod:`app.services.appliance.k8s_proxy` (#183 Phase 4). Where that
module carries one specific payload (a raw kubeapi HTTP request bound
for ``127.0.0.1:6443``), this one carries an *already-validated* nettool
job — a tool name plus a structured params dict the supervisor maps to
its local nettool runner. We deliberately never ship a raw shell string
or a pre-built argv-with-untrusted-tokens; the supervisor rebuilds the
argv from the structured params with the same allowlist validators the
api container uses, so the channel is shell-injection-safe end-to-end.

Mechanism (identical shape to k8s_proxy):

  * Per-appliance ``asyncio.Queue`` of inbound commands.
  * Per-request ``asyncio.Future`` for the inbound result, keyed by
    ``request_id`` so reply delivery is O(1).
  * The control plane ``enqueue_command(...)`` puts a command on the
    appliance's queue and awaits its future; the supervisor long-polls
    ``pop_command(...)``, runs the tool against its local vantage, and
    POSTs the structured result back through ``deliver_result(...)``.

In-memory, per-replica — same tradeoff k8s_proxy made. Requests are
short-lived request/response pairs that complete within seconds; on
restart every queue clears and the operator just retries. See the
``_Dispatch`` seam below for the multi-replica Redis-HA follow-up.

Readiness check: unlike k8s_proxy (which only blind-enqueues and lets
the operator time out at 30 s when the supervisor is offline), this
module exposes :func:`appliance_ready` so the router can fail FAST with
a 503 instead of hanging the operator for the full timeout when the
appliance hasn't heartbeated recently or isn't approved.

Failure modes:
  * Appliance offline / not approved → ``enqueue_command`` raises
    :class:`ApplianceOffline` *before* the long wait (router → 503).
  * Operator timeout → ``asyncio.TimeoutError`` (router → 504); the
    queue entry is marked cancelled so the supervisor's next poll skips
    it.
  * Supervisor returns a structured tool result → forwarded verbatim to
    the awaiting future.

Scope (this PR): the ``appliance`` vantage only. The DNS / DHCP
service-container vantage and a Redis-backed multi-replica dispatch are
explicit follow-ups; the seams for both are marked below.
