"""Issue #154 — appliance NTP support (chrony).

Source-of-truth lives on ``platform_settings``; this module renders
an ``/etc/chrony/chrony.conf`` payload from those columns and folds
the rendered text into the DNS + DHCP ConfigBundle long-poll so
every appliance host picks it up the same way Issue #153 (SNMP)
distributes snmpd.conf.

Design notes:

* chrony already ships in mkosi.conf and the postinst enables it
  with a default ``pool pool.ntp.org iburst`` line (cloud-init's
  default). So unlike SNMP — which we ship disabled — NTP is
  always running. This module just lets operators steer the source
  list (air-gapped, internal NTP, compliance shops, …) and
  optionally turn the appliance into a time server.
* chrony supports a hot reload of the server lines via
  ``chronyc reload sources``, but reloading via the systemd unit
  re-reads the whole config — including ``allow`` lines — which
  is what we need for the ``ntp_allow_clients`` path. So the
  runner uses ``systemctl reload chrony`` for everything.
* No secrets — NTP hostnames are not sensitive. Contrast with
  SNMP where the v2c community is a Fernet-encrypted credential.
  The flat read endpoint returns the whole shape directly.
* Empty / inert configurations still produce a *valid* chrony.conf
  body so the runner can compare byte-for-byte against the on-disk
  file and skip the reload when nothing changed.
