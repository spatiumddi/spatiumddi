"""Appliance-host packet-capture dispatch (#59 Phase 2).

The appliance vantage runs tcpdump on the appliance **host** (real NICs),
not in a container — so the capture rides the supervisor channel. Unlike
:mod:`app.services.appliance.agent_cmd` (an in-memory per-replica queue
for short request/response nettools), the authority here is the
``packet_capture`` **DB row**: a minutes-long job that outlives any single
poll and is replica-agnostic — *any* api replica can serve the
supervisor's poll because the claim is a guarded UPDATE against the shared
Postgres, not an in-memory queue (which would strand a capture enqueued on
a different replica — the #430-class delivery gap we explicitly avoid).

Flow:
  * supervisor long-polls ``/supervisor/pcap/poll`` → :func:`claim_next`
    atomically claims the oldest ``queued`` appliance-vantage row for the
    caller's appliance and returns a structured command (never a shell
    string);
  * supervisor POSTs progress → :func:`record_progress` (returns the
    cancel flag so the host runner can stop);
  * supervisor streams the finished ``.pcap`` to ``/supervisor/pcap/upload``
    → :func:`finalize_capture` stamps the terminal state.

A backstop reaper (``app.tasks.pcap.prune_captures``) fails any row stuck
non-terminal past its deadline, so a lost supervisor never freezes a row.
