"""CSV import of an estate's existing AE Title table — issue #723.

Every hospital that runs DICOM already has this table. It is a
spreadsheet, it is out of date, and it is the only record of which AE
Titles are taken — which is exactly why PS3.15's registry object exists
and exactly why nobody deploys it. So the first thing this module has to
do well is ingest that spreadsheet without arguing with it.

Shape follows the tree's other importers (``services/ot/importer.py``,
``services/ipam_io``): a **preview** that is pure planning with zero
writes, then a **commit** that re-plans from the same request body and
applies it. Re-planning on commit is what keeps the server stateless
between the two calls — no preview token to expire, and a concurrent
change lands as a plan difference rather than a stale write.

Two contracts differ from the OT importer, both because an AE Title is
not an address:

* **The join key is ``ae_title``, not the IP.** That is the identity
  DICOM cares about, and it is what the unique constraint is on. Two
  rows in one file sharing a title is a per-row error, because that is
  the collision the whole registry exists to surface — reporting it at
  import is strictly better than letting the second row win silently.
* **The address column is optional.** A blank address is not an error,
  it is an *unbound reservation*: a title still burned into peer
  configuration across the estate whose host has been decommissioned.
  Refusing those would force operators to omit exactly the rows most at
  risk of being re-issued to someone else. A *supplied* address that
  IPAM does not know is still an error, matching the OT importer — an
  export is an enrichment source, not an address-plan source.

Per-row errors never abort the batch: a 400-row table with three bad
cells imports 397 and reports three.

No network I/O, and no PHI: the columns below are network identity only.
