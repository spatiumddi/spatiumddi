"""IPAM print / PDF export (#82).

A static, handover-shaped deliverable for an IPAM subtree: the address
plan as it stands, rendered server-side so what the operator hands an
auditor doesn't depend on their browser, zoom level, or which columns
they happened to have toggled on.

Two report shapes, chosen by scope — the same scope selector the
CSV / JSON / XLSX exporter already takes:

* **space or block** → *tree* report. Summary counters, the block
  hierarchy indented by nesting depth, then every subnet with its
  utilization.
* **subnet** → *detail* report. The subnet's own facts, its custom
  fields, and (opt-in) its address table.

Follows the reportlab pattern already shipped in
``services/conformity/pdf.py`` and ``services/audit_report.py`` — a
synchronous render after the async DB work, dispatched to a worker
thread so it cannot stall the event loop. The issue text proposed
weasyprint; adding a second PDF engine (plus its Cairo / Pango system
libraries) to render tables we already know how to render would be a
large dependency for no capability we don't have.

Unlike those two, this one paginates properly: repeating table headers
plus a numbered page footer, because a printed address plan is read as
paper and "page 3 of 11" is what makes it checkable.

    behaviour of the spreadsheet exporter.

    The render pass is synchronous reportlab, and THIS FUNCTION already
    runs it in ``asyncio.to_thread`` — a caller must simply await it.

    worker thread an async function returns an un-awaited coroutine
    instead of PDF bytes, and fails silently apart from a
    ``coroutine was never awaited`` warning.
