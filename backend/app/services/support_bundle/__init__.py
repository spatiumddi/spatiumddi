"""Platform-wide support bundle (issue #875).

Builds a zip an operator can attach to a **public** GitHub issue.
Attachments there are effectively world-readable, so the bundle is
scrubbed by default and the unscrubbed variant is a deliberate,
differently-named opt-in for local debugging.

Three-step flow rather than one download, because proposal 3 of the
issue asks for a self-review step and it is the right shape anyway:

1. :func:`generate` builds the archive and a preview (file list, sizes,
   what the scrubber replaced, a redacted sample).
2. The operator reads the preview and downloads the archive.
3. If support later says "n123.d456.invalid is unhealthy", the decode
   map answers which host that is.

The decode map is returned by a **separate** call and never written into
the archive. A bundle carrying its own decoder is not scrubbed, it is
merely inconvenient to read.

Assembly is in memory. A zip's central directory is written last, so
true streaming needs a third-party writer, and the honest alternative is
a hard cap — :data:`~.collect.CAP_TOTAL_BYTES` — that bounds peak RSS
instead of pretending the problem away.
