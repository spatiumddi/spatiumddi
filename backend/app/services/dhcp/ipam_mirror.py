"""Idempotent IPAM mirror-row creation for DHCP lease ingestion (#564).

Several DHCP lease-ingestion paths mirror a lease (or static
reservation) into an ``ip_address`` row with an unguarded
``SELECT (subnet_id, address); if None: INSERT`` pattern:

* Kea agent lease push — ``api/v1/dhcp/agents.py``
* poll/sync path — ``services/dhcp/pull_leases.py`` (reachable from
  the **Sync DHCP** button)
* static-reservation mirroring — ``api/v1/dhcp/statics.py``

Under concurrency (the agent pushing ``/lease-events`` while an
operator clicks **Sync DHCP**, or a static reservation created for an
IP that currently holds a dynamic lease) two writers both look up the
address, both see "no row", both ``INSERT``, and the loser hits
``uq_ip_address_subnet_address`` — a 500 whose
``PendingRollbackError`` tail then poisons the rest of the batch. On a
busy DHCP host new leases arrive continuously, so it recurs and
*feels* persistent, though each occurrence self-heals.

The codebase already hardened this exact race elsewhere — the
``pg_try_advisory_lock`` guard in ``tasks/ipam_discovery.py`` (#515)
and the conflict-SELECT guard in ``unifi/reconcile.py``. This helper
brings the same protection to the DHCP paths using the savepoint
fall-through style: attempt the ``INSERT`` inside a SAVEPOINT so a
unique-violation rolls back only the nested transaction (leaving the
outer session usable — no ``PendingRollbackError`` tail), then
re-select the row the concurrent writer committed and hand it back so
the caller falls through to its update path.

    Adds ``row`` to the session and flushes it inside a SAVEPOINT.

    * On success returns ``(row, True)`` — ``row`` now has its PK

    * If a concurrent writer already committed the same
      ``(subnet_id, address)`` pair (the ``uq_ip_address_subnet_address``
