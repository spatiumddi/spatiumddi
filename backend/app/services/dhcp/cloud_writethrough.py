"""Write-through to agentless cloud/REST DHCP providers (FortiGate today).

Companion to :mod:`app.services.dhcp.windows_writethrough`. Where the
Windows driver takes per-object cmdlets, a cloud driver (subclass of
:class:`app.drivers.dhcp._cloud_base.AgentlessDHCPDriverBase`) takes the
**whole DHCP-server object per scope** — so every scope / pool / static /
option edit re-pushes the scope's full desired state, rebuilt from the DB.

Called from the scope / pool / static API endpoints (via the
``windows_writethrough`` helpers, which fan out to both Windows and cloud
members) **after** the DB is flushed but **before** commit, so a REST
failure surfaces as a 502 and rolls the transaction back — keeping the DB
and the FortiGate in sync.
