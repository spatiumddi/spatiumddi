"""Compile fingerbank device classes into Kea client-class expressions (#700).

The operator picks device *categories*; this module turns them into
something a DHCP server can actually evaluate.

**Why this is a compiler and not a lookup.** Fingerbank classifies a
device by querying their corpus with the DHCP signature it emitted.
Kea cannot do that mid-packet, and there is no ``device-class ==
IoT`` predicate to render. What Kea *can* test is the signature
itself — option 55 (parameter request list) and option 60 (vendor
class identifier) — which is precisely the input that produced the
classification. So the compiler collects every signature we have
observed and had classified into the selected classes, and emits an
OR over those signatures.

The gap between "the category" and "signatures we have observed in
the category" is the honest limit of the feature, and every surface
states it rather than implying instant enforcement: a device whose
signature is new to us matches nothing until it has been seen and
classified once, which is why v1 is *classify on first lease, apply
on renewal*.

Three properties this module is responsible for, each of which is the
difference between a working policy and a quiet misfire:

**Ambiguous signatures are excluded by default.** DHCP signatures are
not unique to a device class — a minimal parameter-request-list like
``1,3,6,15`` is emitted by embedded Linux in a doorbell and by a rack
server alike. If a signature appears on devices both inside and
outside the selected classes, matching it applies the policy to
devices the operator did not choose. For a feature whose headline use
is "put unknown devices in a quarantine pool with a restricted
resolver", silently including such a signature is how the CEO's
laptop ends up quarantined. They are excluded, counted, and listed;
``include_ambiguous`` is the explicit opt-in.

**Nothing device-controlled is interpolated as a string.** Option 60
is a value the *device* chooses, and it lands inside a config file
whose syntax has quoting. Both halves of every term are emitted as
hex literals (``option[60].hex == 0x4D5346...``), so a vendor-class
of ``' or 1--`` becomes inert bytes rather than expression syntax.
Verified against kea-dhcp4 3.0.3: the hex form parses and the same
payload as a quoted string does not survive as syntax.

**The output is deterministic.** Signatures are sorted before
rendering, because the expression rides the config bundle's ETag —
an unstable ordering would shift the ETag on every rebuild and make
every agent in the group re-fetch and re-render identical config.
