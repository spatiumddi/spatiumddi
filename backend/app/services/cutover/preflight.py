"""Phase 3a pre-flight — drop DNS TTLs so a rollback is measured in minutes.

The switch itself is a delegation or forwarder change made outside SpatiumDDI.
Its blast radius is therefore governed entirely by how long resolvers keep
serving the old answers, and that is the TTL. A zone sitting on the common
3600 default means a bad cutover is visible for an hour after it is reverted;
lowered to 300 well ahead of the window, the same mistake clears in five
minutes. Nothing else in the cutover buys as much safety for as little effort.

What this module does, on the SpatiumDDI side:

* Snapshots the zone SOA (``ttl`` / ``minimum`` / ``refresh`` / ``retry``) and
  **every** record's ``ttl`` into ``CutoverItem.ttl_snapshot`` — once. A second
  apply (say, dropping from 300 to 60) must not overwrite that snapshot, or the
  restore would put the zone back to an intermediate value that was never the
  operator's configuration.
* Lowers ``zone.ttl`` / ``zone.minimum`` and every record whose ``ttl`` exceeds
  the target. Records with ``ttl IS NULL`` inherit ``zone.ttl``, so lowering the
  zone changes them implicitly; they are set **explicitly** to the target and
  snapshotted as ``None``, so a restore can put the inheritance back rather than
  leaving them pinned to whatever the zone default happened to be.
* Pushes the changes through the ordinary record pipeline: one
  ``bump_zone_serial`` for the whole batch, then ``enqueue_record_ops_batch``.
  No private fan-out — the batch path already handles agentless (one driver
  call) and agent-based (queued rows per server) correctly.

What it deliberately does **not** do is lower the TTLs on the Windows source,
even though those are the values resolvers are actually caching today and are
therefore the ones that matter. Record writes to a Windows DNS server ride
RFC 2136 by default, where "change the TTL" is expressed as a delete of the
rrset followed by an add — and we are not issuing an unattended delete against
a zone that is still live and authoritative for production. (The WinRM Path B
alternative is no better here: it is a clone-and-``Set`` per record against
that same live zone.) Instead ``TTLPreflightPlan.source_side_instructions``
carries a copy-pasteable PowerShell block for the operator to run there, and
the runbook repeats it. A TTL drop applied to only one side is worse than none
at all — it looks done and buys nothing — so the instructions are part of every
preview and apply response, not an optional extra.

Neither :func:`apply_ttl_preflight` nor :func:`restore_ttl_preflight` commits;
the caller owns the transaction.
