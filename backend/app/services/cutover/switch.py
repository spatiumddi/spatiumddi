"""The switch itself, and its reversal — Phase 3c of the cutover (issue #756).

Everything up to here is reversible bookkeeping. This module is the moment the
migration becomes visible to clients, so it is deliberately the smallest,
least clever code in the package:

* **It re-derives the blocker set before it does anything.** A parity report or
  a readiness check from twenty minutes ago is a claim about the past. The
  blockers are recomputed against live state and a ``severity == "block"``
  entry refuses the switch outright, ``force`` or not. That refusal is the
  whole reason the package exists — the headline hazard is cutting over an
  AD-integrated zone whose dynamic updates are "Secure only", because GSS-TSIG
  is unimplemented (#444) and a domain controller that cannot re-register its
  SRV records turns a DNS migration into a domain outage.
* **DHCP is switched in one order and only that order.** The Windows scope is
  deactivated *first*, then the managed scope is activated. Two DHCP servers
  answering for one subnet hand out conflicting addresses within seconds, so a
  window where both are live is worse than a window where neither is. If the
  managed side then fails to come up, the Windows scope is put back.
* **The commit is sequenced by this module, not by the caller.** Both DHCP
  paths pair an irreversible WinRM call with a database write, so *where* the
  transaction commits relative to that call decides what a crash leaves behind.
  The router hands in a ``finalize`` callable (write the audit row, commit) and
  this module decides when to invoke it — see ``_cutover_dhcp`` /
  ``_rollback_dhcp``. Committing at the wrong point is how a failed transaction
  ends with both servers answering, which is the one outcome the ordering above
  exists to prevent.
* **DNS is not switched here at all.** There is no server-side flag we own:
  which server answers for a zone is decided by the delegation at the parent
  (or by what the resolvers forward to), and both live outside SpatiumDDI. So
  the DNS path records the transition and returns the instructions. It never
  touches the Windows zone — deleting or disabling the old zone before the
  delegation has actually moved removes the thing that is still serving.
