"""Operator runbook generator for a cutover plan (issue #756).

:func:`render_runbook` turns a plan and its items into markdown that gets
pasted straight into a change ticket. It is deliberately not a summary of
what SpatiumDDI already did — it is the document the operator works from
during the window, so it carries the Windows-side PowerShell we deliberately
do **not** run for them, the exact order of operations, and a rollback with a
number attached.

Two things here are load-bearing rather than decorative:

* **The Windows-side TTL block.** SpatiumDDI lowers TTLs on its own copy of a
  zone during pre-flight, but the currently-authoritative TTLs — the ones
  resolvers are actually caching — belong to the Windows server. Lowering only
  our side is worse than lowering neither, because it produces a runbook that
  claims a five-minute rollback while the world still holds hour-long answers.
  So the block is emitted, with the item's real target TTL baked in.
* **The stated recovery time.** Every rollback section names a concrete number
  derived from that item's actual pre-flight TTL (or lease time), and says so
  when no pre-flight has been run — an unquantified "roll back if it goes
  wrong" is what turns a bad cutover into a long one.

Nothing is escaped: the output is markdown for humans, and zone names / scope
ids are DNS labels and IP addresses.

    ``reports`` maps ``str(item.id)`` to a freshly-computed

    item without a fresh report falls back to its persisted ``last_parity``
    blob, so a runbook generated without re-running the checks still states the
    last known parity rather than claiming nothing is known.

    ``source_dns_host`` / ``source_dhcp_host`` are interpolated into the
    PowerShell blocks. When omitted, an obvious placeholder is emitted instead
    — the plan row carries only FK ids, so the caller is the one that knows the
    hostnames.

    ``propagation_seconds`` maps ``str(item.id)`` to the item's real
    propagation constant: the zone's currently-served TTL for a DNS item, the
    scope's lease time for a DHCP item. Supplying it is what makes the stated
    recovery time exact rather than derived from the pre-flight snapshot.
