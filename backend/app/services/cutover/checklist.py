"""Phase 4 decommission checklist for the Windows cutover (issue #756).

The switch is the visible part of a migration; the decommission is the part
that bites weeks later. A Windows DNS server left running with scavenging on
quietly deletes the fallback copy of the zone. A DHCP server left *authorized
in Active Directory* starts answering again the first time it is patched and
rebooted, racing the managed scope for the same subnet. A conditional
forwarder on one resolver in one branch office keeps a whole site resolving
from a box everybody believes is retired.

None of that is discoverable from the cutover state, so it is a checklist: a
static catalog of the things that have to be true before the Windows side is
switched off, with per-plan state so an operator's ticks and notes persist.

Two rules shape the module:

* **The catalog is versioned code, the ticks are data.** :func:`read_checklist`
  merges the two at read time and writes nothing; a row appears only when the
  operator first ticks or annotates a line
  (:func:`upsert_checklist_row`). So a plan created three releases ago picks up
  items added since — with their current wording — without losing a tick, and
  without a page load turning into a database write.
* **Auto-checks never tick a box.** :func:`evaluate_auto_checks` returns
  advisory state next to each item. Some of the catalog is genuinely
  answerable from the database, and surfacing that saves real work, but the
  operator is the one who decides an item is done. A checklist that ticks
  itself is a checklist nobody reads.
