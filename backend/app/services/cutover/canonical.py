One module so parity, readiness, shadow, pre-flight, lease-handover, and the
router all agree on the same shapes — the same reason the importers keep a

# ── Parity ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

#: How a single difference between SpatiumDDI and the live Windows server is
#: explained to the operator. The distinction that matters for a migration is
#: *why* the two sides differ, not merely that they do:
#:
#: ``drifted_since_import``
#:     Windows has it, SpatiumDDI doesn't, and the SpatiumDDI object carries
#:     import provenance — so it was imported once and Windows has moved on.
#:     These are the ones a re-import (or a manual add) has to catch up.
#: ``never_imported``
#:     Windows has it, SpatiumDDI doesn't, and there is no import provenance —
#:     the object was created here by hand, or imported from somewhere else.
#:     Nothing "drifted"; it was simply never brought across.
#: ``intentionally_diverged``
#:     SpatiumDDI has it, Windows doesn't. Almost always an operator addition
#:     made after the import. Surfaced, never auto-reconciled.
#: ``value_mismatch``
#:     Both sides have the name+type, with different data. Reported as one
#:     difference rather than the missing+extra pair #61's drift report would
#:     produce, because during a migration "the value changed" is a different
#:     decision from "a record appeared".

        ``unmatched``  — the object exists on one side only, so there is
                         nothing to diff. ``error`` says which side is missing.
        ``error``      — the pull failed (WinRM / auth / PowerShell). Never
                         raises: a failed parity check must not take down a
                         whole-plan run.
        ``unverified`` — the pull *returned*, but its result cannot be trusted

                         be dangerous, so it gets its own status.

    report (see ``parity._comparable_record``). They are excluded from both
