"""DHCP lease handover — Phase 3b of the Windows cutover (issue #756).

The DHCP importer (#129) deliberately carries scopes, pools, options and
*reservations* across and stops there: leases are ephemeral state, and an
importer that invents reservations out of them would be lying about operator
intent. A **cutover** is the one moment where that trade flips. At the instant
the managed scope starts answering, Kea's lease database is empty — so the
first client to renew is handed a fresh address out of the pool while it is
still using, and still answering on, the one Windows gave it. On a busy
subnet that is a wave of duplicate-address complaints during the exact window
an operator is least able to absorb them.

This module closes that gap: it reads the live Windows lease set and turns
each one into a :class:`DHCPStaticAssignment` on the managed scope, so a
renewing client gets **the address it already holds**. The reservations are
stamped ``import_source="windows_cutover"`` so they are trivially identifiable
afterwards — an operator who wants the addresses back in the dynamic pool can
find and drop exactly this set once leases have naturally churned.

Three things are load-bearing here:

* **Scope selection is by subnet CIDR.** The driver's neutral lease dict
  (``WindowsDHCPReadOnlyDriver.get_leases``) carries no scope id, so
  containment in the managed scope's subnet is what decides whether a lease
  belongs to this item. Every lease the server reported still gets an explicit
  disposition in the plan rather than silently vanishing — an operator
  reviewing a handover should be able to account for the whole lease table.
* **Nothing is created that would contradict an existing reservation.** The
  ``uq_dhcp_static_scope_mac`` / ``uq_dhcp_static_scope_ip`` partial unique
  indexes are on *live* rows, so a duplicate is an ``IntegrityError`` at flush
  and not a silent no-op. Duplicates are classified up front, and the commit
  re-checks against live DB state rather than trusting a stale preview.
* **Each create gets its own savepoint.** One reservation that cannot be
  written (a racing operator edit, an IPAM mirror collision) must never roll
  back the ones that already succeeded — same ledger idiom the importers use.
