"""Is this item safe to cut over yet? (#756)

Every reason an item is *not* ready is a :class:`~app.services.cutover.canonical.Blocker`
with a stable code and one of two severities. ``warn`` is advisory and can be
acknowledged with ``force=true``; ``block`` refuses the cutover outright and
cannot be forced, ever.

**The one that matters is** ``ad_secure_dynamic_update``. A Windows zone set to
AD "Secure only" dynamic updates accepts registrations exclusively over
GSS-TSIG. SpatiumDDI does not implement GSS-TSIG yet (#444), so the moment that
zone is served from here instead, every domain controller and domain-joined
client silently fails to register — no error the operator will see, just an
Active Directory that stops resolving itself. That is the difference between a
DNS migration and a domain outage, so it is a hard block and
:func:`normalize_dynamic_update` is written to be paranoid about detecting it:
Windows' ``DynamicUpdate`` arrives from ``ConvertTo-Json`` either as the string
(``None`` / ``NonsecureAndSecure`` / ``Secure``) or as the raw enum integer
(``0`` / ``1`` / ``2``), and both forms are handled. An AD-integrated zone whose
mode cannot be interpreted at all is treated as ``Secure``, because "we could
not tell" must not read as "it is fine".

:func:`refresh_blockers` deliberately performs a **live** read of the source
Windows server rather than trusting anything cached on the item. The whole guard
is worthless if an operator can flip a zone to "Secure only" on Windows after
the last parity run and still be allowed to cut over. It persists the result
onto ``item.blockers`` but does not commit — the caller owns the transaction.
