"""Approval gate — the single interception point risky handlers call (#62).

A covered delete handler calls :func:`gate_or_execute` at the top. The
return value tells the handler what to do:

* ``None``  → no approval required. The handler executes inline exactly as
  today (delegating to ``operation.apply``). This is the *default* path:
  the ``governance.approvals`` module is off out of the box, and even when
  on, only enabled policies gate. Behaviour is byte-identical to pre-#62.
* :class:`ChangeRequestPending` → a policy matched and the caller can't
  self-approve. A ``change_request`` row is persisted (+ its ``requested``
  audit row, committed) and the handler must return ``202 Accepted`` with
  ``pending.as_dict()`` instead of executing.

Control flow (pinned by the #62 design):

1. Module off → ``None`` (never touches the policy table).
2. Derive ``(action, resource_type)`` for the policy lookup *directly*
   from the operation's ``required_permission`` (e.g. ``("delete",
   "subnet")``) — no hand-maintained name→action map to drift out of
   sync (#2/#3). An import-time assertion proves every registered risky
   op carries a ``required_permission`` so a future op that forgets one
   fails loudly at boot rather than silently never-gating.
3. ``match_policy`` → no enabled match → ``None``.
4. Superadmin caller + ``not policy.applies_to_superadmin`` → ``None``.
5. ``operation.preview`` → if not ok, raise 409 (don't queue a doomed
   request — matches today's inline 409).
6. Persist the ``change_request`` (+ audit), commit, return the pending.

#4 (audit-before-respond): the ``requested`` audit row is committed inside
:func:`create_change_request` before this returns. #2 (async throughout):
everything here is async.
