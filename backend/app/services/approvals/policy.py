"""Approval policy engine (#62).

Pure async decision layer: given an ``(resource_type, action[, count])``
tuple, return the strongest *enabled* :class:`ApprovalPolicy` that
matches, or ``None`` when no approval is required. Kept side-effect-free
and superadmin-agnostic on purpose — the *gate* (``gate.py``, later
slice) decides the superadmin bypass using the returned row's
``applies_to_superadmin`` flag. Splitting the decision this way keeps the
engine trivially testable and the gate the single place authorization is
applied.

# whose ``required_permission`` produces the policy's (action, resource_type).
# In P1 the only gated action is ``delete`` and the only gated resource types
# are the six delete-covered families. The policy CRUD validates against these
# sets so an operator can't create an *enabled-but-inert* policy for an action
# that isn't wired yet (the fail-open #2/#4 the seed used to ship). P2 widens
# both sets as bulk_delete / bulk_edit / bulk_allocate / factory_reset /
# import_commit ops land their gate threading.
