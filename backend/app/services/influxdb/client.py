"""Version-aware InfluxDB write client (issue #889).

Three declared versions, **two** wire dialects:

===== ============================== ==============================
ver   endpoint                       auth
===== ============================== ==============================
v1    ``/write?db=<database>``       HTTP basic (``username`` /
                                     ``password``), omitted entirely
                                     when both are blank
v2    ``/api/v2/write?org&bucket``   ``Authorization: Token <token>``
v3    ``/api/v2/write?bucket``       ``Authorization: Bearer <token>``
===== ============================== ==============================

``v3`` covers every InfluxDB 3 product (Core, Enterprise, Cloud
Dedicated, Cloud Serverless). They all accept the v2 write endpoint;
a v3 *database* is named in the ``bucket`` parameter and ``org`` is
accepted-and-ignored by Core / Enterprise, so it is sent only when the
operator set one (Cloud Serverless does use it). Bearer is the token
scheme InfluxDB 3 documents; ``Token`` also works there, but not the
other way round, so the two are kept distinct rather than collapsed.

An operator pointing ``v1`` at an InfluxDB 3 server puts the API token
in the *password* field — that is the documented compat shim, and it
needs no code here beyond basic auth already sending it.
