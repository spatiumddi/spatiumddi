"""Wake-on-LAN magic packet (issue #533).

Pure-Python magic-packet build + UDP broadcast send. The control-plane
(server vantage) uses this directly; the appliance vantage runs an
equivalent ``_run_wol`` on the supervisor agent so the packet originates
on the target's L2 segment (WoL only wakes a NIC that receives the frame
on its own broadcast domain).

WoL is IPv4-only here: the magic packet rides a UDP broadcast and IPv6 has
no broadcast address. The 102-byte AMD Magic Packet is 6×0xFF followed by
16 repetitions of the target MAC.
