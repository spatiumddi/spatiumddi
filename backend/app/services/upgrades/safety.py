"""Cross-cutting safety rails for the rolling-upgrade orchestrator (#296 Phase H).

Two surfaces:

1. **In-flight global mutex** — when a SystemUpgradeRun is non-
   terminal (``planned`` | ``running`` | ``halted``) the orchestrator
   owns the cluster. Operator-triggered "wreck the cluster"
   operations (full-system backup creation + restore, factory reset,
   future promote/role-change paths) must refuse rather than race the
   orchestrator's mid-flight state. ``assert_no_upgrade_in_flight``
   is the gate; endpoints call it after their other auth checks and
   before any mutation.

2. **Post-upgrade cluster verification** — Phase C's per-node
   ``_step_cluster_verify`` re-runs a cheap subset of preflight
   (replication lag + quorum). Phase H expands that with two
   cluster-wide checks: CNPG instance count =
   ``Cluster.status.readyInstances`` matches spec; every DaemonSet
   pod across the cluster reports Ready (closes failure-mode #21 at
   the cluster scope rather than just per-node). The MetalLB VIP
   Service endpoint check called out in the original issue body is
   deferred — it depends on the data-plane VIP work (#272 Ph10) for
   a shape-stable target to query.

The mutex doesn't try to be a transactional lock — concurrent reads
of the system_upgrade_run row are fine. A real race between the
mutex check + an upgrade.start would be caught later by the partial
unique index ``ix_system_upgrade_run_one_active``. This module's job
is the operator-facing nicety: surface a clear 409 with the
in-flight run's id + state rather than the bare unique-violation
error a race would otherwise produce.
