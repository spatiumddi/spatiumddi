"""Canonical IR shared by the NetBox one-shot importer (issue #36).

The NetBox source reader (``fetch.py`` + ``mapping.py``) pulls upstream
IPAM / tenancy / dcim-org objects and maps them onto this neutral shape
so the commit endpoint can stay source-agnostic — exactly the contract
:mod:`app.services.dns_import.canonical` establishes for the DNS
importers. The shape is deliberately a strict subset of what the IPAM
ownership / network tables carry: enough to recreate each row faithfully,
no source-specific extensions. Anything NetBox carries that we can't
model lands in :attr:`ImportPreview.warnings` so the UI can surface it on
the preview rather than dropping it silently.

Two deliberate narrowings vs the DNS IR (issue body §4.3):

* :data:`ImportSource` is the single value ``"netbox"`` (the DNS IR is an
  11-value Literal because cloud providers stamp their provider name).
* :data:`ConflictAction` is ``skip | overwrite`` with **no ``rename``** —
  NetBox entities are CIDR / rd / name-keyed and can't be renamed (the
  DHCP importer's IR makes the same narrowing for the same reason).

Every created row is also stamped with its NetBox primary key
(``custom_fields["netbox_id"]`` where the model has a ``custom_fields``
column, else ``tags["netbox_id"]``; VLAN has neither, so its only
idempotency anchor is the ``import_source`` / ``imported_at`` provenance
columns the migration adds — see ``netbox_ctx/03_models.md``). The IR
carries ``netbox_id`` as a plain field on every dataclass that maps to a
created row; the committer decides where it lands per-model.
