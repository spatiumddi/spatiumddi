"""The IANA root-zone TLD list: bundled snapshot + operator refresh (#986).

Two sources, one effective answer:

* **Bundled** — ``backend/app/data/iana_tlds.json``, regenerated at
  release-prep by ``scripts/refresh_iana_tlds.py``. Always present, so
  classification works on an air-gapped install that has never made an
  outbound call.
* **Snapshot** — a one-row ``tld_registry_snapshot`` table an operator
  fills with ``POST /api/v1/dns/tld-registry/refresh``. Postgres rather
  than a file on disk because a node-local file does not propagate across
  a multi-node control plane (the #886 logo reasoning).

The snapshot wins only when its ``version`` is *newer* than the bundled
one. That direction matters: a fresh release ships a newer bundled list
than a year-old snapshot, and silently preferring the stored copy would
make an upgrade lose TLDs.

**This module is deliberately stdlib-only at runtime.**
``scripts/refresh_iana_tlds.py`` imports :func:`parse_tld_payload` from
here so the download guard the script applies is byte-for-byte the one the
running control plane applies — two copies of a validator that are meant to
agree is the bug class this repo keeps finding (see #878). Keeping the
import cheap is what lets that script run under a bare ``python:3.12``
with no backend dependencies installed, so the SQLAlchemy import below is
``TYPE_CHECKING``-only and the model import is function-level.
