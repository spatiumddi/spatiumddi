"""DNS pool apply-state service.

Bridges ``DNSPoolMember`` state to actual ``DNSRecord`` rows. For every
healthy + enabled member there should be exactly one ``DNSRecord``
(name = pool.record_name, type = pool.record_type, value =
member.address, pool_member_id = member.id). For every unhealthy or
disabled member, that record should not exist.

This service is called from the pool health-check task after each
member-state evaluation; it diffs current records against what
``apply_pool_state`` says should exist and emits create/delete ops.

Driver-agnostic: emits regular ``enqueue_record_op`` calls so BIND9 +
Windows DNS render unchanged. The records themselves carry
``pool_member_id`` so the records UI can flag them as pool-managed and
record CRUD endpoints reject operator edits.
