"""DNS pool health-check engine.

Runs per-member checks (``tcp | http | https | icmp``) and updates
``DNSPoolMember`` state based on the consecutive-success / -failure
thresholds. Members that flip state trigger the pool apply-state
service to add or remove the corresponding ``DNSRecord`` rows so the
rendered record set reflects only healthy + enabled members.

ICMP shells out to ``/bin/ping`` (Debian's iputils-ping) which ships
with ``cap_net_raw+ep`` so the non-root app user can fire ICMP
echo-requests without ``CAP_NET_RAW`` on the container. The API
Dockerfile installs the package explicitly.

Where the checks run: from the API process (Celery worker container).
Phase 2 = delegate to a chosen DNS agent (matters for split-horizon
setups + private-network targets the API can't reach).
