"""Ingest-back for externally-injected DDNS records (issue #641, Alt.1).

When an operator enables dynamic updates on a zone, a third-party writer
(an AD domain controller, a DHCP server registering A/PTR) can inject
records straight into the running daemon over RFC 2136. Those records live
only in the daemon's journal — the control plane, which treats the DB as
the source of truth, doesn't know about them, so a full re-render (cold
boot, from-scratch re-seed, zone-file path change) would drop them.

The agent closes the loop: it AXFRs each dynamic zone from loopback, diffs
the live records against the set the control plane shipped in the bundle,
and POSTs the *unknown* records here. We persist them as ordinary
``DNSRecord`` rows stamped ``import_source="ddns_external"`` so they become
UI/IPAM-visible and survive a re-render.

Conflict rule: **control-plane-managed names win.** An incoming record
whose ``(name, record_type)`` collides with a control-plane-managed row
(anything not itself an ``ddns_external`` mirror) is skipped — the operator's
declared state is authoritative. External-only names are preserved.

The agent sends the *complete* current external set for the zone each
cycle, so this reconciles: rows that vanished upstream are removed, new
ones are added. Zone-management + DNSSEC RRs (SOA, apex NS, RRSIG, NSEC*,
DNSKEY, CDS/CDNSKEY, private-type 65534) are never ingested — BIND owns them.
