"""Nudge DNS agents when the cert their DoT/DoH listener serves changes (#50).

A DoT / DoH listener serves an ``ApplianceCertificate`` row, which the
config bundle carries to the agent as PEM (see
``app.services.dns.agent_config``). Both renewal paths rewrite ``cert_pem``
**in place** on the existing row — the ACME orchestrator on auto-renewal,
and the operator pasting a re-signed cert back into a CSR-pending row — so
the pointer stays valid and only the material changes.

That material is inside the hashed bundle body, so the etag shifts and
agents converge on their own. This module only makes it *prompt*: without a
wake the change lands on the next safety tick instead of within a second.
Per cross-cutting pattern #2 the wake stays advisory — never the sole
delivery path — and ``publish_wake`` swallows its own errors, so a Redis
outage can never break the caller.
