"""CSV import of an engineering-tool device export — issue #542.

Plant inventories live in TIA Portal / Studio 5000 exports and in the
spreadsheets those exports become. This module ingests one of those
files and stamps the OT descriptor onto IPAM addresses that **already
exist**. It never creates an ``ip_address`` row: an engineering export
is an enrichment source, not an address-plan source, and letting it
invent IPAM rows would quietly turn a typo'd column into a fake subnet
occupant that nothing ever cleans up. Rows whose IP is unknown to IPAM
come back as per-row errors so the operator can decide — allocate the
address properly first, or fix the export.

Shape follows the tree's other importers (``services/ipam_io``,
``services/dhcp_import``): a **preview** that is pure planning with zero
writes, then a **commit** that re-plans from the same request body and
applies it. Re-planning on commit is what keeps the server stateless
between the two calls — there is no preview token to expire, and a
concurrent change lands as a plan difference rather than a stale write.

Per-row errors never abort the batch. A 400-row export with three bad
cells imports 397 rows and reports three errors, matching the IPAM
address importer's contract; an operator fixing a plant inventory wants
the good rows in, not an all-or-nothing rejection.

No network I/O — this is CSV text in, database rows out.
