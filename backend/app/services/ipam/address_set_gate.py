"""Address-set write-delegation gate (issue #103).

A caller without subnet-wide ``write`` may still mutate an IP if it falls
inside an :class:`~app.models.address_set.AddressSet` they hold
``write``/``admin`` on. The control plane resolves the caller's writable
ranges on a subnet ONCE per request (:func:`load_writable_set_ranges`) and
then checks each candidate IP against them (:func:`user_can_write_ip`).

Both the interactive IPAM router and the import path consume these helpers;
they live here (not inside ``ipam.router``) so neither side reaches across
modules via a function-local import that would break only at runtime if a
helper were renamed (#12).

Representation (#10): contiguous sets become ``(start_int, end_int)`` interval
tuples (O(interval-count) membership), and explicit sets become a hash SET of
packed host ints (O(1) membership) so a large explicit set doesn't degrade to
an O(n) linear scan per candidate IP.
