"""Free-space finder — sweep an IPSpace (or one block subtree) for unused CIDRs.

Walks every IPBlock in the space (or, when ``parent_block_id`` is set, just
the subtree rooted at that block), computes the set of CIDRs that are
"allocated" inside it (the union of direct child blocks and direct child
subnets — nested children are accounted for inside their own parent), and
slides a window of the requested prefix length through the resulting free
gaps to surface candidate CIDRs.

Design choices worth recording:

* **Direct-child accounting only.** A block's free space is the difference
  between its own CIDR and the union of its *direct* descendants. Nested
  grand-children are handled when we recurse into the parent block, not
  here. This mirrors ``GET /ipam/blocks/{id}/free-space`` and keeps the
  arithmetic O(children) per block instead of O(descendants).
* **Address family is a hard filter.** Mixed v4 / v6 IPSpaces are
  legal (operators sometimes co-locate the two for one site under one
  VRF row). The caller asks for a single family; blocks of the wrong
  family are skipped without penalty.
* **No per-subnet free-IP scan by default.** ``min_free_addresses`` is an
  opt-in additional pass that, after the block-level scan finds a
  candidate, looks up whether the candidate actually exists as a subnet
  and (if it does) checks ``Subnet.total_ips - Subnet.allocated_ips``
  against the threshold. Most callers want "find me an unused CIDR" and
  the existing-subnet branch is rarely useful — but operators who want
  "find me a subnet that already exists and has at least N free hosts"
  get exact semantics with this opt-in.
* **Sliding-window enumeration.** ``ipaddress.IPv4Network.subnets(new_prefix=)``
  iterates every aligned sub-CIDR of the parent. We filter out the ones
  that overlap any allocated child. ``summarize_address_range`` would be
  cheaper for huge sweeps but the result is canonical-form supernets
  rather than aligned candidates of the requested prefix. The sliding-
  window form is what the caller expects — they asked for /24s, they
  should get aligned /24s.
* **Cap.** Hard cap of 100 candidates regardless of caller ``count``;
  enumeration over a /8 looking for /29s would otherwise emit millions
  of rows. The dataclass result honours the caller's lower cap when
  set.
