"""Fleet-wide MAC → vendor rollups (issue #917).

"How many Apple devices are on my network?" is a question the copilot could
answer and the REST API could not: single-MAC lookup exists at
``POST /tools/mac-vendor`` and lease/address lists carry a per-row ``vendor``,
but the rollup itself lived only in ``count_devices_by_vendor`` /
``find_devices_by_vendor``. Over REST that meant paging the entire address
space client-side and doing the OUI join by hand.

Both the copilot tools and the new ``/ipam/reports/vendors`` routes call this
module, so the two surfaces cannot disagree about what counts as a device.

Everything degrades cleanly when ``PlatformSettings.oui_lookup_enabled`` is
off: :func:`bulk_lookup_vendors` returns ``{}``, so the rollup reports zero
matches with an unchanged shape rather than erroring.
