"""New-device (arpwatch-style) detection — classification + ingest helpers.

Issue #459. The platform already logs every observed ``(ip, mac)`` pair into
``ip_mac_history`` (issue #369). This module adds the *classification* layer on
top of that store: deciding whether a freshly-observed MAC is something the
operator already trusts (``known``), has dismissed (``acknowledged``), or has
never seen before (``new``) — the last being what raises a ``new_mac_seen``
alert and a ``device.first_seen`` event.

Design notes:

* **One store, not two.** We extend ``ip_mac_history`` rather than build a
  parallel sighting table — see ``docs/features/IPAM.md`` §8.x. Every ingestion
  path (DHCP lease, SNMP ARP, ping/ARP sweep, L2 sniff) routes through
  :func:`app.services.ipam.discovery.record_mac_observation`, which calls
  :func:`classify_mac` on first sight.
* **Allowlist is MAC-keyed, sightings are (ip, mac)-keyed.** The allowlist
  (``mac_allowlist``) survives the cascade-delete of the IP a MAC was first
  seen on, and silences a trusted MAC wherever it appears. Acknowledgement, by
  contrast, dismisses one specific ``(ip, mac)`` sighting.
* **Randomised MACs are flagged, not hidden.** Modern phones rotate
  locally-administered MACs per network; :func:`is_locally_administered`
  stamps ``ip_mac_history.is_randomized`` so the default alert rule can skip
  them and avoid a reconnection storm, while they stay visible in the review
  queue.
