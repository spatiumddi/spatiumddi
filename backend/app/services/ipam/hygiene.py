"""On-demand IPAM hygiene report (issue #917, over the #369 detections).

The three hygiene detections have existed since #369 as *alert rules*: a
scheduled evaluator matches them against configured thresholds and fires
events. That answers "tell me when this becomes true", which is the right
shape for monitoring and the wrong one for triage — an operator standing at a
patch panel wants "is anything squatting in my static ranges **right now**",
at a threshold they choose, without having to first configure a rule.

``find_ip_hygiene_findings`` (the copilot tool) already did exactly this by
calling the alert matchers with a transient rule as a threshold carrier. It
was the only surface that could: no REST route existed, so the mobile client
and every other API consumer could see these findings only as fired events, at
whatever thresholds the operator had configured. That asymmetry is what #917
catalogued.

This module is the shared implementation both now call, so the copilot answer
and the REST answer cannot disagree — and both stay pinned to the *alert*
matchers, so a tuning change to a detection reaches all three surfaces at once.

    * ``stale_reservations`` — ``reserved`` / ``static_dhcp`` rows nothing has
      seen in ``stale_reservation_days``. Requires at least one prior sighting,

    * ``unknown_mac_in_static_range`` — a reservation whose recently observed
      MAC differs from the recorded one. Operator-set ``mac_address`` is never
      overwritten by discovery, so a differing recent observation is a genuine
      "someone else is answering on this IP".
