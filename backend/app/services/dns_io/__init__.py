"""DNS zone-file parsing, diffing, and writing.

All zone-file I/O lives here so routers remain thin and driver/service
code does not leak into the API layer (see CLAUDE.md non-negotiable #10).

Public API:
    parse_zone_file(text, zone_name) -> list[ParsedRecord]
    diff_records(parsed, existing) -> ZoneDiff
    write_zone_file(zone, records) -> str
