"""E911 exports — CSV and IOS LLDP-MED snippets (#972 Phase 3).

Two generated artefacts, and **neither makes an outbound connection or
writes a device**. SpatiumDDI does not push switch configuration (see
[#60], closed as not planned); these produce text an operator reads,
reviews, and applies themselves.

* **CSV** — every ERL with its civic elements, ELINs, validation verdict and
  the network bindings pointing at it. For bulk review, for a spreadsheet an
  auditor asked for, and as the thing a shop already running Cisco Emergency
  Responder maps into CER's own ERL bulk load.
* **IOS snippets** — `location civic-location` / `location elin-location`
  stanzas plus the per-interface `location civic-location-id` lines, so a
  switch can announce location to phones over LLDP-MED. That is the one
  delivery mechanism that needs no HELD, no DHCP option and no phone-side
  configuration at all.

**The load-bearing work here is sanitisation, not formatting.** Both outputs
interpolate operator-typed free text, and both targets treat a newline as a
statement separator:

* A room named ``312\\nno logging`` in an IOS snippet is arbitrary
  configuration pasted into a switch by an operator who trusted us.
* A building named ``=cmd|' /C calc'!A0`` in a CSV is a formula that executes
  when the file is opened in Excel.

So every value is sanitised for its target, and a value that cannot be made
safe is dropped with a comment saying so rather than silently mangled — an
ERL missing its room is visibly incomplete, where a quietly-altered one is
not.

**Verification status, stated plainly:** the IOS command shape follows the
Cisco LLDP-MED location configuration guide and has **not** been applied to
a real switch from this code, which is why the snippet carries a header
saying it is generated for review. The CSV column names are ours; CER's
bulk-load columns differ between versions, so the operator maps them. Both
points are in the docs rather than implied away.
