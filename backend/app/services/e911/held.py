"""HELD — HTTP-Enabled Location Delivery, RFC 5985 (#972 Phase 1b).

The standards-track protocol a PBX, an E911 provider or a phone uses to
ask "where is this device?" and get PIDF-LO back. This is the surface that
makes the feature work with **no phone-side change**: CUCM, Cisco MPP
firmware, the Webex app, RedSky "HELD+", Intrado ERS and Bandwidth DLR all
speak it already.

Two request shapes:

* **Third-party** (RFC 6155) — the caller names the device by IP, MAC or
  LLDP chassis+port inside a ``<device>`` element. This is the PBX case,
  and it is authenticated like any other API call.
* **Self** (RFC 5985 §6) — a device asks about *itself* and carries no
  identity at all; the LIS answers from the TCP source address. That is
  Phase 2 and is off by default, because it is an unauthenticated surface.

**XML from the network is untrusted input**, so three things are
deliberate. The body is size-capped before it is parsed. A ``DOCTYPE`` is
refused outright rather than relied on to be harmless. And parsing goes
through ``xml.etree.ElementTree``, which supports no DTD and no external
entities at all — so XXE and entity-expansion are not mitigated here, they
are unavailable. ``lxml`` is present in the image (python3-saml pulls it)
and would need ``resolve_entities=False``, ``no_network=True`` and
``load_dtd=False`` set correctly on every parser instance to reach the same
place; ``defusedxml`` would be a new dependency needing a NOTICE entry and
a ``versions.json`` pin. The stdlib parser is the one that is safe by
construction.

**Identity elements are matched by LOCAL NAME, not by namespace.**
Deliberate, and the reason is honesty about what has been verified: the
element set here follows RFC 6155 as far as IP and MAC, which are
unambiguous, while the exact spelling a given vendor emits for a
switch-port identity has NOT been checked against a live client. Matching
on local name means a client whose namespace differs still works, and an
element we do not recognise is reported as unsupported rather than
silently treated as "no identity given" — which would quietly answer with
the *caller's* location instead of the device's, the worst failure this
surface can have.
