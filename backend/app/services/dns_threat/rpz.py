"""RPZ hit attribution — which clients keep reaching for blocked names (#699).

We serve curated blocklists as RPZ zones and, before this, discarded
every hit. That left the most operationally useful thing the blocklists
can tell you unanswerable: a blocked lookup is not a problem, but a
host generating thousands of them is an infected machine announcing
itself, and we were throwing that away.

Pure reporting — unlike the other three detections there is no scoring
here, because there is nothing to infer. A hit is ground truth: named
matched a policy and said so. The job is only to attribute hits to
clients and feeds and rank them.

**PASSTHRU is not a block.** It is an explicit allow — an exception
entry that let a name through *past* a blocklist. Counting it as a
block would inflate every client's number and, worse, would make a
correctly-configured allowlist look like an infection. Every function
here separates the two.
