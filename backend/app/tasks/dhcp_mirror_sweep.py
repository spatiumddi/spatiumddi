"""Recurring repair for stranded DHCP-reservation IPAM mirrors (#620).

A reservation owns an ``ip_address`` row (``status="static_dhcp"``, back-linked
by ``static_assignment_id``). Every path that destroys a reservation is supposed
to release that mirror first — #618 wired up the ones that didn't, and #620
fixed the Windows scope reconciler, which used to Core-DELETE every reservation
under a scope and re-insert it under a fresh id on every poll, orphaning the
mirror of anything an operator had created in the UI.

So why sweep at all, if the paths are fixed? Because of how this fails. A
stranded mirror is silent and unrecoverable from the UI: the address sits at
``static_dhcp`` pointing at a reservation Postgres has dropped, so it is neither
allocated nor free, nothing hands it out, and no amount of clicking frees it —
every release path looks the mirror up by the reservation's *current* id and
matches nothing. The last one took a one-shot repair migration
(``d7b3f2a9c15e``) to clean up. This is that migration's step 1 made recurring,
so the next one — from a path nobody has thought of yet — costs an operator
nothing and heals within the hour.

Cheap by construction: the predicate matches only provable residue, so on a
healthy install it finds nothing and writes nothing (not even an audit row).
