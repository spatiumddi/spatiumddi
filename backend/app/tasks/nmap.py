"""Celery wrapper for on-demand nmap scans.

The runner in :mod:`app.services.nmap.runner` does all the real work;
this module exists purely so the API can dispatch a scan onto a
worker and return 202 immediately. A *started* scan is never retried —
re-running on a worker crash would replay potentially noisy port
traffic without consent. The **only** retry is for a not-yet-visible
row (``NmapScanRowMissing``): that fires before any scan traffic and
absorbs the dispatch-before-commit race (#510).
