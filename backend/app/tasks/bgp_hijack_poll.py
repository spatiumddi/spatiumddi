"""Periodic BGP prefix-hijack poll (issue #527).

Beat fires this hourly; the task itself is the RELIABLE source of truth
for prefix-hijack detection (the optional RIS Live WebSocket consumer in
``app.services.bgp.ris_live`` is a real-time upgrade the feature never
depends on). It:

1. Gates on ``PlatformSettings.bgp_monitoring_enabled`` — a no-op when
   the operator hasn't opted in.
2. Refreshes the auto-managed ``bgp_tracked_prefix`` rows for every
   public ASN (from RPKI ROAs + RIPEstat announced-prefixes).
3. Evaluates every enabled tracked prefix whose ``next_check_at`` has
   elapsed: queries RIPEstat for the current announcements, records a
   ``bgp_hijack_detection`` for every unexpected origin (exact-prefix or
   more-specific), and bumps ``next_check_at`` forward by the configured
   interval.
4. Resolves detections whose announcement has been absent past the
   delist window.

The detection table is the latch/dedup state — an ongoing announcement
keeps one open row and fires exactly one ``AlertEvent`` via the standard
alert evaluator. Idempotent: re-running before anything is due is a
no-op; a still-active announcement just bumps ``last_seen_at``.
