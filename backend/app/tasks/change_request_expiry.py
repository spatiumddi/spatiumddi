"""Sweep change requests whose ``expires_at`` has passed — issue #62.

Beat fires every 60 s (always-on; the per-row ``expires_at`` is the only
knob — stamped at request time from the matched policy's ``ttl_hours``).
Idempotent: only matches rows that are still ``pending`` AND past
``expires_at``, so re-running on a quiet system picks up nothing new and a
row that an approver/requester already decided is never touched.

For each match the sweep flips ``pending`` → ``expired`` (terminal) and
writes one ``change_request.expired`` audit row attributed to the
synthetic ``system`` actor (NN #4 — every state change is audited). The
approve endpoint also lazily expires a row it finds stale on read, so a
request never executes past its TTL regardless of when this sweep runs;
the sweep is the durable bookkeeping layer that clears the queue.

Resilience (#12): the sweep processes one row at a time, each re-locked
``FOR UPDATE`` and re-checked for ``state == "pending"`` inside its own
transaction. A row an approver / requester flips out of ``pending`` between
the candidate SELECT and the per-row lock is skipped (not an error), and a
single row that raises is logged + skipped rather than aborting the whole
batch — so one wedged row can't strand the queue.
