"""Beat-driven sweep that fires due restore-verification drills
(issue #702).

Tick cadence: every 60 s, matching the backup-target sweep. Each
tick walks every enabled target with drills turned on and a
``drill_next_run_at`` now in the past, and runs one drill for it.
:func:`run_drill_for_target` re-stamps ``drill_next_run_at`` from
the cron after the run lands, so a row won't fire twice in the
same tick.

Per-target dispatch is mutexed by ``drill_last_status =
"in_progress"``, which the runner stamps on entry — a drill that
spans several ticks (a large archive can) won't double up.

A drill replays a full dump into a scratch database, so it is
substantially more expensive than a backup. That cost is the
reason drills carry their own cron rather than riding
``schedule_cron``: weekly drills against nightly backups is the
expected shape.
