"""Beat-driven sweep + shared runner for Scheduled Wake-on-LAN — Phase 1
(issue #586).

Tick cadence: every 60 s. Each tick walks every **enabled** schedule with a
non-NULL ``schedule_cron`` whose denormalised ``next_run_at`` (UTC) is now in
the past, and fires it. The runner recomputes ``next_run_at`` after the run
lands — in *every* branch (fired, gated-skip, failed) — so the row can't
re-fire in the same tick and a sick schedule retries next cadence instead of
hot-looping.

Per-schedule dispatch is mutexed by an ATOMIC claim: the runner stamps
``last_run_status = "in_progress"`` + ``in_progress_since = now`` via a single
``UPDATE … RETURNING`` that only wins when the row isn't already claimed (or its
lease has expired). This is the single source of truth for the mutex — race-free
across overlapping sweeps and concurrent run-nows (no in-memory pre-check to go
stale). A worker that crashes mid-run leaves the claim stamped; the next runner
reclaims any row whose ``in_progress_since`` lease exceeds ``CLAIM_LEASE_SECONDS``
(default 15 min), fails the orphaned ``wol_run``, and re-fires — so a crash can
never wedge a schedule forever. Combined with the always-advancing
``next_run_at`` this makes a double-tick a no-op (non-negotiable #9 — idempotent
+ safe to retry).

The task also re-checks the ``tools.wake_scheduler`` feature module inside its
body (non-negotiable #14) — a disabled module fires nothing even while beat
keeps ticking.

Two entry points share one runner (:func:`run_wol_schedule`):

* :func:`sweep_wol_schedules` — the beat task (scheduled fires, gate applied).
* :func:`run_schedule_now` — the callable the ``run-now`` REST endpoint reuses
  (manual fire; the built-in holiday gate is *bypassed* because a manual
  "wake now" is an explicit operator action).

A gated-off scheduled occurrence still writes a ``wol_run`` (with the
run-level ``skip_reason``) AND advances ``next_run_at`` — "skipped because
holiday" is visible history, never a silent no-op.

    1. **Atomic, attempt-anchored claim** — ``UPDATE wol_run SET
       verify_state='verifying', verify_claimed_at=now WHERE id=run AND
       verify_state='pending' AND verify_attempt=:attempt``. Only one worker
       wins the row lock + ``pending`` guard, so a concurrent double-delivery of
       the same attempt is a no-op and a re-fire after ``done`` is a no-op. The
       ``verify_attempt`` guard additionally makes a SEQUENTIAL redelivery of
       attempt N (arriving after a re-wake already advanced the row to N+1 +
       reset it to ``pending``) a no-op, so the down set is never re-woken twice

    2. Probe the still-unverified SENT targets under the schedule's
       ``verify_method`` (ping / tcp / seen / auto) + stamp the Seen infra on
       active responders (``verify_run_targets``).
    3. **Bounded retry** — if non-responders remain AND ``attempt <=
       verify_retries``, re-wake ONLY those (reuse the dispatch path), bump
       their ``wake_attempts``, release the mutex back to ``pending`` while
       advancing ``verify_attempt`` to ``attempt+1``, and re-enqueue
       ``attempt+1`` with a ``verify_wait_seconds`` countdown.
    4. Otherwise **finalise** (``done`` + count rollup + audit).

    Crash recovery: the post-claim body is wrapped so a plain exception resets
    the mutex back to ``pending`` (self-heal via the reaper); a worker SIGKILL
    leaves the row wedged at ``verifying`` but ``verify_claimed_at`` lets the
    sweep's verify reaper (:func:`_sweep`) reclaim it after
    ``VERIFY_CLAIM_LEASE_SECONDS`` and re-enqueue at ``verify_attempt``.

    Bound proof: ``attempt`` is strictly incremented and the re-enqueue guard is
    ``attempt <= verify_retries``, so at most ``verify_retries`` re-waves fire;
    the terminal ``done`` state + the attempt-anchored ``pending`` claim
    guarantee no unbounded loop and no double-wake even under a redelivery.
