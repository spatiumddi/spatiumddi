"""Celery task — fingerbank lookup + IPAddress stamping for one MAC.

Triggered from the agent ingestion endpoint per fresh fingerprint.
Idempotent — running it twice for the same MAC is a no-op on the
second call (cache window) plus a redundant UPDATE on every matching
IPAddress row (no-op semantically). Safe to retry.

Why it's a task instead of inline: fingerbank's API takes 100-500ms
per call and we don't want to block the agent's bulk POST behind a
synchronous round-trip.
