"""Periodic IPAM utilization recount sweep (issue #521).

Recomputes ``Subnet.allocated_ips`` + ``utilization_percent`` for every
non-deleted subnet, and the recursive ``allocated_ips`` / ``total_ips`` /
``utilization_percent`` rollups on ``IPBlock``, correcting any drift that
crept into the cached counters. Drift accumulates from the handful of code
paths that adjust a counter by an estimated delta rather than a fresh count
— the CSV/XLSX address importer bumps ``subnet.allocated_ips`` by a
computed delta, bulk integration reconcilers insert rows in bulk, and any
partial-failure path that mutates a row but not the cache leaves the two
out of step.

Idempotent + cheap by design:

  * ONE grouped ``COUNT(*) WHERE status != 'available'`` over
    ``ip_address`` (grouped by subnet_id) — NOT a per-subnet ORM loop, so
    it scales to 10k+ subnets on a single round-trip.
  * A single in-memory pass over the block tree for the recursive rollup
    (mirrors ``_update_block_utilization`` in the IPAM router — full-CIDR
    denominator, BIGINT-clamped ``total_ips``, ``deleted_at IS NULL``
    guards on both blocks and subnets).
  * Only rows whose cached value actually drifted are written, so a
    converged install commits nothing and writes no audit row.

Always safe to run — it never touches semantic state, only derived
counters — so there's no platform-settings gate; the beat entry fires it
hourly.
