"""Pod-posture gate for the rendered charts (#983).

Two properties that are trivially forgotten on a NEW workload and invisible
once forgotten, because nothing fails — the pod schedules and runs, just
without the protection:

  seccomp        every pod template carries ``securityContext.seccompProfile``.
                 Kubernetes runs a container ``Unconfined`` unless asked;
                 docker-compose applies the runtime's default profile to every
                 service. A workload that omits this runs with FEWER syscall
                 restrictions under Kubernetes than under Compose.

  priority       every pod template carries a non-empty ``priorityClassName``.
                 With every pod at priority 0, kubelet eviction under memory
                 pressure picks the pod that grew the most rather than the one
                 that matters least. Only asserted for renders that opted in
                 (``--require-priority``), because the umbrella chart's default
                 is deliberately empty: naming a PriorityClass that does not
                 exist makes the apiserver reject the pod outright, so a
                 bring-your-own cluster must not get one by default.
                 A workload that is MEANT to sit at priority 0 is named in
                 ``--allow-no-priority``, so the decision is visible at the
                 call site and a NEW workload still fails the gate.

``--allow-no-seccomp`` exists for the same reason and is used for exactly one
thing: a vendored subchart whose templates expose no pod-securityContext knob,
so no values override can supply a profile. Exempting it is strictly better
than the alternative, which is not rendering that chart at all — which is how
its pods got missed in the first place.

Exemption names match either exactly or on a ``-<name>`` suffix, because helm
prefixes a subchart's workload names with the release name. The suffix is not
segment-aware — ``k8s`` would also match ``frr-k8s`` — so write exemptions as
the full workload name, never an abbreviation.

Both are checked against the RENDERED manifests rather than the templates: a
``with`` guard on the wrong values path renders nothing and reads fine in the
template. Reference: the #917 lesson that a guard which inspects intent instead
of output reports clean while the defect ships.

Usage:
    chart-pod-posture.py [--require-priority] [--allow-no-priority a,b]
                         [--allow-no-seccomp a,b] file...

    """Match an exemption exactly, or on a ``-<name>`` suffix.

    Helm prefixes a subchart's workload names with the release name, so the
    same object is ``frr-k8s`` in the chart and ``metallb-bgp-frr-k8s`` in a
    render — an exact-match-only exemption would silently stop applying the
    moment the render name changed.

    The suffix test is not segment-aware, so a short exemption over-matches
    (``k8s`` catches ``frr-k8s``). That is a reason to write full workload
    names, not a reason to hand-roll boundary parsing: an over-broad
    exemption still has to be typed by someone, in a file under review.
