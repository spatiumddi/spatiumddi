# trivy-gate.sh — turn a Trivy image report into a publish/refuse verdict.
#
#   usage: .github/scripts/trivy-gate.sh <trivy-report.json> <image-ref>
#
# The report is what `trivy image --format json` wrote for <image-ref>,
# scanned with `--severity HIGH,CRITICAL --ignore-unfixed` — so every
# finding in it is one Trivy believes has a fix. This script asks the
# one question Trivy cannot: is that fix INSTALLABLE from the package
# index the image builds against, right now?
#
# Trivy's "fixed" comes from the distro's security database. Alpine's
# secdb is updated when the fix is COMMITTED to aports; the built .apk
# reaches dl-cdn hours later (the builders and the CDN sync are separate
# steps). In that window a finding is "fixed" to Trivy and unfixable to
# `apk upgrade` — no Dockerfile change can clear it, and a gate that
# fails on it just blocks the nightly until the mirrors catch up.
# nightly-20260905 died exactly this way: util-linux 2.42.3 landed in
# aports at 00:08Z, the frontend image's fresh `apk upgrade` at 10:45Z
# picked up every other fix on the mirror but libuuid stayed at
# 2.42.1-r0 (7 HIGH), and the package appeared on the CDN at 13:53Z.
#
# Each finding is sorted into one of three outcomes:
#
#   FAIL   the index offers a version >= the fixed one. A rebuild would
#          cure this (stale layer cache, missing `apk upgrade`, a floor
#          that needs bumping) — the image must not ship. Exit 1.
#   DEFER  the index offers nothing newer, or something newer that is
#          still below the fixed version. Announced, not published.
#          Nothing a rebuild can do until the mirrors catch up, so it
#          is treated the way `--ignore-unfixed` already treats the
#          rest: reported (a workflow warning + step summary), not
#          blocking. The next build — whose package layer is rebuilt
#          against the current index — picks the fix up. Exit 0.
#   FAIL   the image's package manager is not one this script can ask
#          (apk and apt today), the probe itself failed, or the finding
#          is a language package (a new PyPI/npm release is always
#          installable). Availability is unknown, so the outcome is what
#          it was before this script existed: refuse. Exit 1.
#
# Debian/Ubuntu images are asked the same question a different way, and
# two details there are load-bearing:
#
#   Silence means the OPPOSITE thing to the two probes. apk's
#   `--simulate` reports only what it WOULD upgrade, so a package missing
#   from its output means "nothing newer exists"; `apt-cache policy`
#   answers for every package it is asked about, so a package missing
#   from ITS output means the index could not resolve the name at all —
#   unknown availability, which is a FAIL, not a DEFER. Reading the
#   second like the first turns a fail-closed branch into a fail-open one.
#
#   The probe has to prove the index was LOADED, not merely that
#   `apt-get update` returned. It returns 0 with every mirror
#   unreachable, and `apt-cache policy` then answers from the local dpkg
#   status file — Candidate == installed, which is non-empty, plausible,
#   and reads as "the fix is not published yet" for every finding at
#   once. See the probe for what is asserted instead.
#
# A missing, empty or unparsable report is a hard failure: an image
# nothing scanned is never a pass.
#
# Requires jq and docker (the image must be present locally, and the probe
# needs network access to the distro's mirrors). If trivy is
# on PATH the familiar table is printed first (`trivy convert`); otherwise
# a compact one is rendered from the JSON.

    #     decision.
    #   `apt-get -s upgrade` — what plain `apt-get upgrade`, the line the
    #     shipped Dockerfiles actually run, would install. apt holds a
    #     package back when upgrading it would pull in a new dependency
    #     or remove something, so this can be lower than the candidate.
