"""#999 Part C — RAID1 mirror + multipath install support.

The pure logic is EXECUTED against stubbed sysfs / block devices rather
than grepped, because every failure mode here is silent:

  * ``partition_node`` returning a path that does not exist makes the
    mkfs that follows create a regular FILE on the installer's tmpfs and
    report success — an install that completes and produces a disk with
    no filesystems on it;
  * a mirror member smaller than the target does not fail, it silently
    shrinks /var, because a RAID1 is the size of its smallest member;
  * a mirror member that resolves to the target is not redundancy, and
    on a multipath LUN "the same disk" can wear two different names.

A structural "the string appears in the file" test catches none of those.
