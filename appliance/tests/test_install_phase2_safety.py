"""#995 Phase 2 — the four safety items (11-14).

Phase 1 fixed things that were wrong. Phase 2 changes what the installer
ACCEPTS, which is a different kind of risk: each of these can refuse an
install that used to succeed, so each one's refusal boundary is pinned
here alongside the thing it was meant to catch.
