"""firstboot's rendered manifests carry the #983 posture bits.

Two things ``spatiumddi-firstboot`` emits that nothing else can:

  * the ``spatium`` Namespace's Pod Security Admission labels — the chart
    deliberately does NOT own the namespace (a chart-owned namespace is what
    ``spatiumddi-helm-stuck-recover`` exists to clean up after), so the
    labels can only come from here;

  * ``global.priorityClassName`` in the ``spatium-control`` HelmChart's
    values, which is what makes the umbrella chart's control-plane
    workloads pick up the ``spatium-control-plane`` class that the
    spatiumddi-appliance chart renders.

The second one has a hazard worth several tests: a pod naming a
PriorityClass that does not exist is REFUSED by the apiserver — the
Deployment is accepted and the ReplicaSet controller then cannot create
pods. The class comes from a *different* release (spatium-bootstrap), so
there are two gates, and both negative cases are asserted here rather than
reasoned about:

  * render time can only see whether the appliance chart's TARBALL exists;
  * ``release_control_manifest`` re-checks against the live cluster and
    strips the reference when the class is not there, so a failed bootstrap
    release costs the ranking rather than the whole control plane.

The stripper is a ``sed`` pattern that has to keep matching what the
renderer emits — a coupling that would otherwise rot silently, so the round
trip is exercised end to end.

Both renderers sit BELOW the ``SPATIUM_FIRSTBOOT_LIB`` early-return, so
they cannot be reached by sourcing the script the way
``test_firstboot_member_guard.py`` does. They are extracted by name and
evaluated on their own instead; ``_extract_function`` fails loudly if the
name is not found, so a rename shows up as an error rather than as a
vacuously passing test.
