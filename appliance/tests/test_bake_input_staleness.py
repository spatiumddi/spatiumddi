"""The bake's staleness guard must key on INPUTS, not on the clock (#1029).

``bake-images.sh`` refuses to bake a SpatiumDDI source image that is out
of date, so an operator who edits code and forgets ``make build`` does
not silently ship a stale ISO. It asked "is this image more than 24 h
old?", which cannot express that: a ``docker build`` that is a COMPLETE
CACHE HIT produces the identical image — same digest, same ID, same
``.Created`` — so an image whose inputs have not changed can never
refresh its own timestamp. It ages past 24 h and then blocks every bake
until somebody passes ``--allow-stale-images``, which is how a guard
stops being read at all.

Observed on the #999 ISO: ``make build`` rebuilt all eight images, and
exactly the three whose Dockerfiles a Dependabot bump had NOT touched
failed at 60 h. A ``docker build --pull`` reproducing the same image ID
proved every build input was unchanged.

So the question is now "was this image built AFTER its inputs last
moved?", answered from git. Three properties are pinned here:

* an image built after its last source change is FRESH however old it is
  — the filed bug;
* an image built before it is STALE however young it is — which the old
  wall-clock rule could not see at all, and which is the real "I forgot
  to rebuild" case;
* an UNCOMMITTED edit counts, because that is the commonest shape of
  that mistake and a commit-time-only comparison would miss it.

The tests execute the real shell functions extracted from the shipped
script — the bytes that ship, not a transcription — against a throwaway
git repository.

HOW TO RUN (from the repo root or this directory):
    python3 -m pytest appliance/tests/test_bake_input_staleness.py -v

No Docker, no root, no appliance ISO required.
