"""The SSH source-CIDR allowlist can finally be enforced (#1009).

``ssh_allowed_source_networks`` has shipped since #157 and, on the default
port, restricted nothing.  ``/etc/nftables.conf`` opened ``tcp dport 22``
unconditionally in its management floor, ABOVE the
``include "/etc/nftables.d/*.nft"`` glob that pulls in the scoped rule
``spatiumddi-ssh-reload`` renders — and nftables is first-match-wins, so the
scoped rule was dead code.  Verified against a real kernel while #1001 was
written: both rules load, the unconditional one lists first.

The floor moves here, to a baked sentinel, for exactly one reason: a rule in
the base config cannot be taken out of the chain, and one in this directory
can — by the same ``apply_sentinel_directive`` machinery
``00-spatium-webui.nft`` has used since #769.

Retiring it removes what ``docs/design/FLEET_FIREWALL.md`` §6.1 calls the
irreducible recovery channel and R1 names as the mitigation for every OTHER
firewall risk, so it happens only under ``ssh_lockdown`` — a second,
default-off switch, which is the shape §6.1 specified (as
``firewall_mgmt_lockdown``) and the anti-lockout pattern pfSense / OPNsense
ship.  An install that never opts in is byte-for-byte unchanged.

HOW TO RUN (from the repo root):
    python3 -m pytest appliance/tests/test_firewall_ssh_sentinel.py -v

No appliance, no nftables, no root — this reads the shipped files.
