"""#995 Phases 4 + 5 — storage hazards, reinstall, and polish (23-30).

Phase 4's headline items (a RAID1 install, a multipath install) need
mdadm / multipath-tools in the image and initramfs work that is NOT here
— see APPLIANCE.md. What IS here is the half that removes the trap: the
picker used to offer each PATH of a SAN LUN as a separate disk and let
you install to one of them, which is worse than unsupported because it
looks like it worked.

  23  refuse an md member          27  live rsync progress
  24  collapse multipath paths     28  Confirm is a menu of fields
  25  reinstall keeping /var       29  export the answers as a preseed
  26  stable disk identity         30  post-install verification

HOW TO RUN (from the repo root):
    python3 -m pytest appliance/tests/test_install_phase45_storage_polish.py -v
