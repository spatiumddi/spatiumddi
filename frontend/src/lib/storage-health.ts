/**
 * Presentation helpers for storage redundancy (#999 Part A).
 *
 * Deliberately contains **no classification**. Whether an array is in
 * trouble, and how badly, is decided once in
 * `backend/app/services/appliance/storage_health.py` and shipped as
 * `findings` / `worst_severity` — the same function the
 * `appliance_storage_degraded` alert rule and the
 * `find_appliance_storage` copilot tool call. Re-deriving that here
 * would be a second copy of the one subtle rule in the feature
 * (severity comes from redundancy remaining, not from the state
 * string), and the failure mode of a drifted copy is a green chip over
 * a red alert.
 *
 * What lives here is only how to render the verdict: colours, and the
 * short labels a chip has room for.
