 * Evaluating the password policy in the browser (#1004).
 *
 * The Change Password screen used to render its rule list and gate its submit
 * button from two different places: the list computed five rows, the button
 * checked only whether the confirm field matched. So an 8-character password
 * under a 12-character policy showed four green ticks and an enabled button,
 * and the server refused it — the browser had already computed the answer and
 * threw it away.
 *
 * Both now come from `evaluatePolicy`, which is the point of the module: one
 * evaluation, used for the display AND the gate, so they cannot disagree.
 *
 * The server stays authoritative. This only avoids a round trip whose outcome
 * the page can already predict — it never *permits* anything, and the rules it
 * cannot check (history) are deliberately not part of the gate.

 *  - a plain string — bad current password, generic failure. Handled.
 *  - an ARRAY of pydantic errors — any `field_validator` on the request
 *    model, which is a 422. An array *is* an object in JS, so the first
 *    branch's `Array.isArray(detail.errors)` was `undefined` and both
 *    branches missed; the page fell through to "Check your current password
 *    and try again". The current password was fine. That message pointed the
