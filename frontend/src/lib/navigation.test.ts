/**
 * Nav gating + ordering (#1068).
 *
 * Two things worth pinning, both found the hard way:
 *
 * 1. Order must survive a disable/enable cycle. `filterNav` preserves array
 *    order today, but "the sidebar reshuffled itself" is exactly the kind of
 *    report that is hard to confirm by reading code, so assert it.
 * 2. A `module` tag on a nav entry is inert unless the renderer actually
 *    filters that group. `dnsSectionNav` carried tags that `Sidebar` never
 *    applied, so with core.dns off its heading rendered over a single
 *    ungated row — the "written, never read" class the #899 audit named,
 *    one layer up in the UI.
