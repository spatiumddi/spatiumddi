/**
 * Remembers the last visited URL (path + search) under a key in sessionStorage
 * and restores it when the user lands on the same module with a "bare" URL
 * (i.e. no query params). This makes switching between IPAM ↔ DNS (or any
 * other sidebar module) feel like each module has its own persistent state.
 *
 * - Only restores when the current URL has no search params, so deep-links
 *   (e.g. `/ipam?subnet=abc` from global search) always win.
 * - Also skips restoration when the current navigation carried router
 *   state — otherwise GlobalSearch's ``navigate("/ipam", { state })``
 *   would be silently clobbered by ``navigate(saved, { replace: true })``
 *   below (the replace drops ``location.state``), wiping the
 *   ``highlightAddress`` before ``SubnetDetail`` ever reads it.
 * - Uses `sessionStorage` so reloading restores but closing the tab clears.
 * - Only writes when search params are non-empty; bare visits don't overwrite
 *   a meaningful saved location.
