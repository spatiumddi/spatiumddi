 * The sidebar's navigation tree, extracted so more than one surface can

 * It lives here rather than inside `Sidebar.tsx` because the Cmd/Ctrl+K
 * command palette also needs it. A second hand-maintained list of pages
 * would drift the first time somebody adds a route and updates only the
 * sidebar — the same argument `lib/shortcuts.ts` makes for keybindings
 * (#737): one definition, several consumers, so retuning it moves
 * everything at once.
 *
 * Module gating is data on the entry, not a branch at the render site, so
 * both consumers apply it identically via {@link navEntryVisible}.
