"""#980 — the two Kea packet-path settings, in both daemon blocks.

Both are rendered rather than left to Kea's defaults, and both defaults were
chosen from measurement against kea-dhcp4 3.0.3 (see
``DHCPServerGroup.kea_thread_pool_size`` for the numbers). What these tests
protect is the wiring: a value that is stored, shipped and then not rendered
is a silent no-op, which is the failure class #430 / #734 / #899 each found
one instance of.
