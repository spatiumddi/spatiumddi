"""Tests for the Kea metrics poller.

Covers the interesting behaviors:
  • first tick after startup establishes a baseline, doesn't report;
  • second tick with a positive delta gets reported upstream;
  • counter-reset (Kea restart) is detected and the bucket is dropped;
  • the #980 loss counters ride the same delta, and ``socket_drop`` — which
    comes from procfs rather than from Kea — stays in lockstep with them.

We test ``_parse_snapshot`` + ``_compute_delta`` directly so the HTTP
client stays out of the test path.
