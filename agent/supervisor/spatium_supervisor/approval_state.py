"""Approval-state tracking for the supervisor (#170 Wave E follow-up).

Before this module the supervisor cached ``cert.pem`` at first
approval and assumed it stayed approved forever. The console
dashboard read that cert's existence as the "Approved ✓" green chip,
even after the operator deleted the appliance row from the Fleet UI
and the heartbeat had been returning 403 / 404 for hours.

This module turns the implicit two-state (no-cert vs has-cert) into
an explicit three-state machine:

* ``pending``   — supervisor hasn't been approved yet (no cert on
                  disk + no claim, OR claim succeeded but admin
                  hasn't approved). Same as the absence-of-file
                  base case.
* ``approved``  — at least one heartbeat in the last
                  ``REVOCATION_STRIKE_LIMIT`` returned 200. This is
                  the steady-state green-chip path.
* ``revoked``   — ``REVOCATION_STRIKE_LIMIT`` consecutive heartbeats
                  returned 403 / 404. The appliance row was deleted
                  (or its supervisor cert was revoked) on the control
                  plane; the supervisor stops applying role
                  assignments and surfaces a red ``Approval revoked``
                  chip on the console dashboard.

The strike counter is the de-noise layer: a control-plane restart
or migration window can produce a short 404 burst that shouldn't
trip a revocation. We require N consecutive 403/404 responses
(N=3 default → ~3 min at the standard 60 s heartbeat cadence) before
flipping state.

Files written under ``state_dir`` (= ``/var/persist/spatium-supervisor``
on the appliance):

* ``approval-state``       — bare text ``approved`` / ``revoked``.
                             Absent = pending.
* ``revocation-strikes``   — integer; how many consecutive 403/404
                             responses since the last successful
                             heartbeat. Reset to 0 on any 200.

Both are atomically written so a supervisor crash mid-flush can't
leave a torn file.
