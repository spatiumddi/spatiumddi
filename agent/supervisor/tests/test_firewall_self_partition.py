"""The firewall must never partition a live etcd member (#593).

The per-role nftables drop-in was rendered purely from the control plane's row
(``cluster_role``). Observed live on a 3-node appliance: ddi2's row had gone
``cluster_role = NULL`` after a failed re-join, while ddi2 was still a voting
etcd member. The supervisor rendered an agent firewall with no ``k3s-peer``
rule, and ddi2's own nftables dropped its peers' inbound raft traffic — the
peers logged ``dial tcp 192.168.0.133:2380: i/o timeout`` every 5 s against a
member that was up the whole time.

The row bug is fixed (#591). The COUPLING is what these tests pin: any
row/reality divergence must not be able to close etcd's peer port on a node
that k3s still calls an etcd member.

Three defences, all covered here:
  1. recover a peer set from live membership when the row supplies none
  2. refuse to apply any body that would close 2380 on a live etcd member
  3. fall back WITHOUT the network when the probe can't run — the supervisor pod
     has no hostNetwork, so its kube reads go to the apiserver ClusterIP and may
     be routed to a REMOTE apiserver. A partitioned node cannot probe, so it
     falls back to a purely local cluster-member signal and then to a previously
     CONFIRMED membership on disk. Only ``True`` is ever remembered: a persisted
     ``False`` would be this bug on disk, since a node promoted while its
     apiserver is unreachable would read "not a member" and partition itself.

And the counter-properties, which matter just as much: a plain agent appliance
(or a node that has never successfully probed) must still get its firewall.
A guard that failed closed there would freeze the ruleset on every non-etcd box.
