"""Supervisor console-mode trigger writer (#393).

``maybe_fire_console_mode`` maps platform_settings.console_mode →
the grubenv ``spatium_verbose`` numeric the host runner + grub.cfg
consume (dashboard→0 / text_console→1 / verbose_dashboard→2), and
writes the verbose-boot trigger only on a real change (idempotent via
the applied sidecar). Replaces the pre-#393 boolean verbose_boot path.

# ── #882 audit: the plane now rides the shared bounded-retry guard ────────
#
# Pre-#882 this writer bypassed ``_fire_host_config`` entirely, so it had
# none of the #387 protections. A runner that could not apply left the
# applied sidecar unchanged, and the next heartbeat rewrote the trigger —
# whose rename re-fires the .path unit — so a failing console-mode apply
# repeated every ~30 s forever, with nothing reported upward.
