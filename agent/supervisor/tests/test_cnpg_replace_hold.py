"""#1059 — the CloudNativePG size hold a dead-node replace arms (heartbeat._ReplaceHold).

Only ``/replace`` sets ``evict_requested`` (a demote is a ``leaving`` row), so an
eviction tick is a replace tick. From it the seed must not scale CNPG down until
the committed count is back at the size CNPG has, or the operator shrinks the
control plane below the count the eviction carried. The backend settles the
evicted row before it answers the next heartbeat, so only the eviction tick
itself carries the name: the hold has to outlive it by the whole install.
