"""#590 / #750 — ensure_coredns_ha matches cluster DNS to the node count.

k3s ships CoreDNS as a single replica that deterministically lands on the
seed and takes the k8s-default 300s to evict — a hard seed kill silences
all Service/pod-FQDN resolution (the api readiness gate's Postgres and
Redis lookups included) for longer than any recovery budget. #590 answered
that with 2 replicas + fast-evict tolerations + REQUIRED anti-affinity.

#750 is the other half: that shape only works once a second node exists.
On a single node the patch rewrites the pod template, so a new ReplicaSet
appears whose pods cannot schedule (required anti-affinity, one node)
while the old one cannot drain (minAvailable 1, zero new pods Ready) —
a rollout stuck forever, blocking every later coredns change.

These tests pin both halves: stock stays stock on one node (no patch at
all), an already-deadlocked appliance is reverted to stock, a real cluster
still gets the full HA shape, the count is capped at 2, a rollout that
could not land is deferred rather than authored, and kubeapi errors
surface.
