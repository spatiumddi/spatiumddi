"""Regenerate ``backend/app/data/iana_tlds.json`` from IANA's root-zone list.

Run at release-prep. Fetches
``https://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt`` — whose first line
carries ``# Version YYYYMMDDNN`` — and rewrites the ``version`` /
``fetched_at`` / ``tlds`` keys of the bundled file.

The ``special_use`` table in the same file is **hand-curated and preserved
verbatim**: it changes by RFC and by ICANN action, not by download, so this
script never invents it. If the file is missing that key the script refuses
rather than emitting a registry with no special-use entries — which would
silently reclassify every ``.local`` and ``example.com`` zone in every
install as "public" on the next release.

This runs on a developer machine, not in the product: it is not one of the
outbound connections ``docs/PRIVACY.md`` enumerates. The in-product
equivalent is ``POST /api/v1/dns/tld-registry/refresh``, which is
operator-triggered, superadmin-only, and documented there.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/refresh_iana_tlds.py            # rewrite in place
    python3 scripts/refresh_iana_tlds.py --check    # non-zero if stale

    We use the product's own parser rather than keeping a second copy: the
