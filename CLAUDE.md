## What Is SpatiumDDI?

SpatiumDDI is a production-grade, open-source **all-in-one DDI (DNS, DHCP, IPAM)** platform. It does not merely configure external DDI servers — it manages and runs the DHCP and DNS service containers directly. The control plane (FastAPI + PostgreSQL) is the source of truth; all managed service containers (Kea, BIND9) are deployed and configured by SpatiumDDI.

It can be deployed as individual containers, a full Docker Compose stack, a Kubernetes application, or as a **self-contained OS appliance image**. Supported on `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` (all Docker images must be built multi-arch).

It is designed to serve both power users (network engineers) and delegated department admins via a granular, group-based permission system. Every feature available in the UI is also available via REST API.

## Absolute Non-Negotiables

These rules apply to every file Claude Code generates. No exceptions.

1. **API-first**: Every UI action must work via REST API
2. **Async throughout**: No synchronous DB or network calls in request handlers
3. **Permissions enforced server-side**: The API always validates authorization independently of the UI
4. **Audit everything**: Every mutation is written to the append-only `audit_log` before the response is returned
5. **Config caching on agents**: DHCP and DNS containers must cache their last-known-good config locally and operate from cache if the control plane is unreachable
6. **No hardcoded secrets**: All credentials via env vars or mounted secrets
7. **Structured logs always**: Every log line is valid JSON with `timestamp`, `level`, `service`, `request_id`
8. **Incremental DNS updates**: DNS record changes use RFC 2136 DDNS or driver API — never a full server restart
9. **Idempotent tasks**: All Celery tasks must be safe to retry
10. **Driver abstraction**: DHCP and DNS backend logic never leaks into the service layer
11. **Multi-arch builds**: All Docker images must support `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`
12. **K8s manifests stay current**: When adding or changing services, update `k8s/base/` manifests and `k8s/README.md` to reflect the change

---

## Cross-cutting Patterns

Three patterns recur across the DNS and DHCP subsystems. Know these before adding a backend feature.

1. **Driver abstraction.** `backend/app/drivers/{dns,dhcp}/base.py` defines an ABC + neutral dataclasses (`ScopeDef`, `ZoneDef`, `ConfigBundle`, etc). Concrete drivers (`bind9.py`, `kea.py`) render backend-specific config from those dataclasses. The services layer only speaks to the ABC via the driver registry — never import a concrete driver from a service.

2. **ConfigBundle + ETag long-poll.** The control plane assembles a `ConfigBundle` from DB state and hashes it to a sha256 ETag (`backend/app/services/{dns,dhcp}/config_bundle.py`). The agent long-polls `/config` with its last-seen ETag; the server blocks until the ETag changes (or timeout) and only then returns a new bundle. When you add a field that affects rendered config, verify it flows into the bundle so the ETag shifts — otherwise agents will not pick up the change.

3. **Agent bootstrap + reconnection.** The agent joins with a pre-shared key (`DNS_AGENT_KEY` / `DHCP_AGENT_KEY`), exchanges it for a rotating JWT, and caches the JWT on disk. On **401 or 404** the agent re-bootstraps from the PSK (the 404 case covers stale server rows after a control-plane reset). The local config cache under `/var/lib/spatium-{dns,dhcp}-agent/` lets the service keep running if the control plane is unreachable (non-negotiable #5).

## Project Phase Roadmap

| Phase | Focus | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Core IPAM, local auth, user management, audit log, Docker Compose | **Mostly done** — LDAP/OIDC/SAML + RADIUS/TACACS+ auth, group-based RBAC enforcement, bulk-edit tags/CF, inherited-field placeholders, and mobile-responsive UI all landed; IPv6 partial |
| 2 | DHCP (Kea), DNS (BIND9), DDNS, zone/subnet tree UI | **Mostly done** (DNS core + Kea DHCPv4 + agent-side Kea DDNS + block/space DDNS inheritance all landed) |
| 3 | DNS views, server groups, blocking lists, VLAN/VXLAN, system admin panel, health dashboard | **In Progress** (DNS views, groups, blocklists, health checks landed) |
| 4 | OS appliance image, Terraform/Ansible providers, SAML, notifications, backup/restore, ACME (DNS-01 provider + embedded client) | **In Progress** (SAML SP landed in Wave A.4; alerts framework landed; appliance, providers, backup, ACME still pending) |
| 5 | Multi-tenancy, IP request workflows, import/export, advanced reporting | Not started |

### Current state

SpatiumDDI cut its alpha release `2026.04.16-1` on 2026-04-16 with IPAM, DNS (BIND9), and DHCP (Kea) all shipping. Subsequent releases landed Windows Server integration (`2026.04.18-1`, 2026-04-18) and the **performance + polish + visibility** release (`2026.04.19-1`, 2026-04-19) — batched WinRM dispatch, DDNS pipeline, the Logs surface (Windows Event Log + DHCP audit), subnet/block resize, subnet-scoped IP import, DHCP pool awareness + dynamic-pool gates, collision warnings, sync modals, dashboard heatmap, draggable modals, standardised header buttons. For the full list of what has landed see `CHANGELOG.md`. The forward-looking work is below.

### Auth waves A–D (landed after `2026.04.16-2`)

**Wave A — external auth providers.** GUI-configured LDAP / OIDC / SAML replacing the old env-var stubs.
- `AuthProvider` + `AuthGroupMapping` tables; Fernet-encrypted secrets (`backend/app/core/crypto.py`).
- Admin CRUD at `/api/v1/auth-providers` with per-type structured forms.
- **LDAP** — `ldap3`-based auth in `backend/app/core/auth/ldap.py`; wired into `/auth/login` as a password-grant fallthrough.
- **OIDC** — authorize / callback redirect flow with signed state+nonce cookie, discovery + JWKS caching, `authlib.jose` ID-token validation; login page lists enabled providers as "Sign in with …" buttons.
- **SAML** — `python3-saml` SP-side flow with HTTP-Redirect AuthnRequest, ACS POST binding, SP-metadata endpoint.
- Unified user sync at `backend/app/core/auth/user_sync.py`: creates/updates Users, replaces group membership with mapped groups, **rejects logins with no mapping match**.

**Wave B — RADIUS + TACACS+.** `pyrad` and `tacacs_plus` drivers added; share the same password-grant fallthrough as LDAP via `PASSWORD_PROVIDER_TYPES`. Admin test-connection probe for each.

**Backup servers for LDAP / RADIUS / TACACS+.** Each password provider's config now accepts an optional list of backup hosts (`config.backup_hosts` for LDAP, `config.backup_servers` for RADIUS/TACACS+). Each entry is `host` or `host:port`. LDAP uses `ldap3.ServerPool(pool_strategy=FIRST, active=True, exhaust=True)`; RADIUS and TACACS+ iterate the primary then backups manually, failing over on timeout / network error and stopping on any definitive auth answer. All backups share the primary's shared secret and timeout settings.

**Wave C — group-based RBAC enforcement.** Permission model (`{action, resource_type, resource_id?}`) with wildcard support; `user_has_permission()` / `require_permission()` / `require_any_permission()` / `require_resource_permission()` helpers in `backend/app/core/permissions.py`. Five builtin roles seeded at startup (Superadmin, Viewer, IPAM / DNS / DHCP Editor). `/api/v1/roles` CRUD + expanded `/api/v1/groups` CRUD with role/user assignment. Router-level gates applied across IPAM / DNS / DHCP / VLANs / custom-fields / settings / audit. Superadmin always bypasses. `RolesPage` + `GroupsPage` admin UI. See `docs/PERMISSIONS.md`.

**Wave D — UX polish + partial IPv6.**
- Per-field opt-in toggles on bulk-edit IPs (status/description/tags/CF/DNS zone individually) plus a "replace all tags" mode.
- `EditSubnetModal` + `EditBlockModal` now show inherited custom-field values as HTML `placeholder` with "inherited from block/space `<name>`" badges; `/api/v1/ipam/blocks/{id}/effective-fields` added for parity with the subnet endpoint.
- Mobile responsive — sidebar becomes a drawer on `<md` with backdrop, `Header` hamburger toggle, 10+ data tables wrapped in `overflow-x-auto` with `min-w`, all modals sized `max-w-[95vw]` on `<sm`.
- IPv6 partial — `DHCPScope.address_family` column + Kea driver `Dhcp6` branch; subnet create skips the v6 broadcast row; `_sync_dns_record` emits AAAA + PTR in `ip6.arpa`; `/next-address` returns 409 on v6 (EUI-64/hash allocation is a future enhancement). Dhcp6 option-name translation now lands in `backend/app/drivers/dhcp/kea.py` via `_KEA_OPTION_NAMES_V6` + `_DHCP4_ONLY_OPTION_NAMES`; v4-only options (`routers`, `broadcast-address`, `mtu`, `time-offset`, `domain-name`, tftp-*) are dropped from v6 scopes with a warning log.

### IPAM polish (shipped alongside the waves)

- **Block overlap validation** — `_assert_no_block_overlap` rejects same-level duplicates and CIDR overlaps in `create_block` + the reparent path in `update_block`.
- **Scheduled IPAM ↔ DNS auto-sync** — opt-in Celery beat task `app.tasks.ipam_dns_sync.auto_sync_ipam_dns`. Beat fires every 60 s; the task itself gates on `PlatformSettings.dns_auto_sync_enabled` + `dns_auto_sync_interval_minutes`, so cadence changes in the UI take effect without restarting beat. Optionally deletes stale auto-generated records.
- **Shared `ZoneOptions` dropdown** (`frontend/src/pages/ipam/IPAMPage.tsx`) — renders primary zone first, `<optgroup label="Additional zones">` below; applied in Create / Edit / Bulk-edit IP modals. Zone picker is restricted to the subnet's explicit primary + additional zones when any are pinned.
- **Bulk-edit DNS zone** — new `dns_zone_id` field on `IPAddressBulkChanges`; each selected IP routes through `_sync_dns_record` for move / create / delete.

### 2026.04.19-1 landings (performance, polish, visibility)

- **Batched WinRM dispatch.** `apply_record_changes` on DNSDriver + `apply_reservations` / `remove_reservations` / `apply_exclusions` on DHCPDriver. Windows drivers override with real batching: DNS at `_WINRM_BATCH_SIZE = 6` ops/chunk (ceiling given `pywinrm.run_ps` encodes UTF-16-LE + base64 through `powershell -EncodedCommand` as a single 8191-char CMD.EXE line; see comment in `drivers/dns/windows.py`), DHCP at `_WINRM_BATCH_SIZE = 30`. Each chunk ships a compact data-only JSON payload + one shared PS wrapper with per-op try/catch. BIND9 / Kea inherit the batch interface via the default loop impls. 40-record Sync DNS went from ~3 min to ~5 s.
- **Logs surface.** New `/logs` page and `api/v1/logs/router.py`. Two tabs:
  - **Event Log** — `POST /logs/query` runs `Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable` server-side via `app/drivers/windows_events.py`. Drivers expose inventory through `available_log_names()` + `get_events()`: `WindowsDNSDriver` returns `DNS Server` + `Microsoft-Windows-DNSServer/Audit`; `WindowsDHCPReadOnlyDriver` returns `Operational` + `FilterNotifications`. Filters keyed into React Query so tab entry + filter changes auto-fetch; Refresh button calls `refetch()`.
  - **DHCP audit** — `POST /logs/dhcp-audit` reads `C:\Windows\System32\dhcp\DhcpSrvLog-<Day>.log` over WinRM via `app/drivers/windows_dhcp_audit.py`. UTF-16 + ASCII both handled. Event-code → human label map; unknown codes come through as `Code <n>`.
- **IPAM subnet + block resize.** Grow-only. Preview + commit endpoints at `/ipam/subnets/{id}/resize/{preview,commit}` and `/ipam/blocks/{id}/...`. Preview returns blast-radius summary + `conflicts[]`; commit requires typed-CIDR confirmation + holds a pg advisory lock + re-runs every validation pre-mutation. Default-named network/broadcast placeholder rows recreated at new boundaries; renamed/DNS-bearing rows preserved. Cross-subtree overlap scan (not just siblings). `ResizeSubnetModal` / `ResizeBlockModal` in frontend.
- **Subnet-scoped IP address import.** `POST /ipam/import/addresses/{preview,commit}`. Parser auto-routes CSV / JSON / XLSX rows (`address`/`ip` → addresses, `network` → subnets); unrecognised columns drop into `custom_fields`. Validates each IP against the subnet CIDR. `AddressImportModal` + combined `Import / Export` dropdown on the subnet header.
- **DHCP pool awareness in IPAM.**
  - `_load_dynamic_pool_ranges` + `_ip_int_in_dynamic_pool` helpers in `backend/app/api/v1/ipam/router.py`. `create_address` returns 422 when `body.address` lands inside a dynamic pool (excluded/reserved pools still allow manual allocation). `_pick_next_available_ip` hoisted from `allocate_next_ip` so both the commit path and the new `GET /ipam/subnets/{id}/next-ip-preview` share the same dynamic-skip semantics.
  - Frontend `tableRows` interleaves ▼ start / ▲ end pool boundary rows with IP rows (dynamic cyan, reserved violet, excluded zinc). `AddAddressModal` "next" mode shows the preview IP inline; manual mode warns + disables submit when the typed IP hits a dynamic range.
- **IP assignment collision warnings.** `_normalize_mac` + `_check_ip_collisions` helpers + `force: bool = False` on `IPAddressCreate` / `IPAddressUpdate` / `NextIPRequest`. 409 with `{warnings, requires_confirmation}` when not forced. Update path uses `model_dump(exclude_unset=True)` so unchanged rows don't surface pre-existing collisions. Shared `CollisionWarning` + `CollisionWarningBanner` in `IPAMPage.tsx`; submit button flips to "Allocate anyway" / "Save anyway" on collision.
- **DHCP stale-lease absence-delete.** `pull_leases` now finds every active `DHCPLease` for this server whose IP wasn't in the wire response and deletes both the lease row and its `auto_from_lease=True` IPAM mirror. `PullLeasesResult` / `SyncLeasesResponse` / scheduled-task audit rows gain `removed` + `ipam_revoked` counters. The time-based `dhcp_lease_cleanup` sweep still handles between-poll expiry.
- **Sync menu + DHCP sync modals.** Replaces the standalone "Sync DNS" button on the subnet detail with a `[Sync ▾]` dropdown (DNS / DHCP / All). `DhcpSyncModal` fans out `POST /dhcp/servers/{id}/sync-leases` across every unique server backing a scope in the subnet, shows per-server counters. `SyncAllModal` combines DHCP results + DNS drift summary in one modal with a "Review DNS changes…" button that chains into the existing `DnsSyncModal`.
- **Refresh buttons** on DNS zone records, IPAM subnet detail, and the VLANs sidebar — each invalidates every relevant React Query key.
- **Dashboard rewrite.** Six KPI cards + **Subnet Utilization Heatmap** (every managed subnet = one grid cell coloured by utilization, click-through to IPAM) + Top Subnets + Live Activity feed (15 s auto-refresh, action-family colour coding) + DNS/DHCP service panel. No historical time-series panels yet — left a clean hook for when snapshot infra lands.
- **Draggable modals.** Seven per-page `function Modal({...})` copies collapsed into a single `<Modal>` at `frontend/src/components/ui/modal.tsx` + `use-draggable-modal.ts` (utility split out so Vite fast-refresh doesn't warn on mixed exports). Title bar is a drag handle; backdrop is `bg-black/20` so the page behind stays readable; Esc closes. Custom modal shapes (header with border-b + footer slot) use `useDraggableModal(onClose)` + `MODAL_BACKDROP_CLS` directly. Migrated across admin, DNS, DHCP, VLANs, IPAM + `ResizeModals` + `ImportExportModals` + inline `DnsSyncModal`.
- **Standardised header buttons.** `<HeaderButton>` primitive with three variants (`secondary` / `primary` / `destructive`) on a shared `inline-flex items-center gap-1.5 rounded-md px-3 py-1.5 text-sm` base. Logical left→right ordering applied everywhere: `[Refresh] [Sync …] [Import] [Export] [misc reads] [Edit] [Resize] [Delete] [+ Primary]`. DNS / DHCP / VLANs were smaller (`text-xs`); all bumped to match IPAM's dominant size.

### Phase 1 — Remaining

- ✅ Full IPv6 — EUI-64 + random /128 + sequential for `/next-address` via `Subnet.ipv6_allocation_policy`; RFC 4291 Appendix A test coverage + dynamic-pool respect on v6; Dhcp6 option-name translation landed 2026-04-19.

### Phase 2/3 — Remaining

- ✅ DDNS pipeline (subnet-level, shipped 2026-04-19 in `feat(ddns)`) — `Subnet.ddns_enabled` / `ddns_hostname_policy` / `ddns_domain_override` / `ddns_ttl`; `services/dns/ddns.py` resolves hostname per policy and calls the same `_sync_dns_record` path static allocations use; `pull_leases.py` + `dhcp_lease_cleanup.py` are the two integration points.
- ✅ Agent-side lease-event DDNS for Kea — `apply_ddns_for_lease` + `revoke_ddns_for_lease` wired into `POST /api/v1/dhcp/agents/lease-events` (commit `bad8cf3`).
- ✅ Block/space inheritance for DDNS settings — `IPSpace` + `IPBlock` carry the four DDNS fields; `Subnet` / `IPBlock` carry `ddns_inherit_settings`; `services/dns/ddns.resolve_effective_ddns` walks subnet → block → space and is consulted by both the hostname resolver and the apply path (commit `a29d4fe`).
- ✅ Per-server zone serial reporting — `DNSServerZoneState` table + `POST /dns/agents/zone-state` for agents + `GET /dns/groups/{gid}/zones/{zid}/server-state` for the UI + sync pill on the zone detail header (commit `{{this-commit}}`).
- ⬜ Trivy-clean + kind-AXFR acceptance tests for the agent images (stubs marked `@pytest.mark.e2e` in `agent/{dns,dhcp}/tests/`; Trivy runs in CI today but with `exit-code: "0"` so findings don't block merges)

### Future Phases — Tracked Items

- ✅ **Windows DNS — Path A (RFC 2136, agentless)** — `WindowsDNSDriver`
  in `backend/app/drivers/dns/windows.py`. Record CRUD only (A / AAAA /
  CNAME / MX / TXT / PTR / SRV / NS / TLSA) via dnspython over RFC 2136;
  zones are managed externally in Windows DNS Manager. Optional TSIG
  signing; GSS-TSIG and SIG(0) are Path B. Control plane sends updates
  directly; `record_ops.enqueue_record_op` short-circuits the agent queue
  for servers whose driver is in `AGENTLESS_DRIVERS`.
- ⬜ **Windows DNS — Path B (WinRM + PowerShell, full CRUD)** — zone
  creation / edit / delete, view config, server-level options. Uses
  `pypsrp`/`pywinrm` to invoke the `DnsServer` PowerShell module on the
  DC. Requires WinRM-over-HTTPS, a service account in `DnsAdmins`, and a
  credential-handling UI in the server form. Secure-only DDNS zones
  become manageable via GSS-TSIG once Kerberos ticket acquisition lands.
- ✅ **Windows DHCP — Path A (WinRM, read-only lease monitoring)** —
  `WindowsDHCPReadOnlyDriver` in `backend/app/drivers/dhcp/windows.py`.
  Implements `get_leases` via `Get-DhcpServerv4Scope` /
  `Get-DhcpServerv4Lease` over WinRM (`pywinrm`). All write methods
  (`apply_config`, `reload`, `restart`, `validate_config`) raise
  `NotImplementedError` — Path A is strictly read-only. Credentials are
  stored Fernet-encrypted on `DHCPServer.credentials_encrypted`. Driver
  registry gains `AGENTLESS_DRIVERS` + `READ_ONLY_DRIVERS` sets mirroring
  the DNS side. Scheduled Celery beat task
  `app.tasks.dhcp_pull_leases.auto_pull_dhcp_leases` fires every 60 s;
  task gates on `PlatformSettings.dhcp_pull_leases_enabled` /
  `_interval_minutes`. Leases are upserted by `(server_id, ip_address)`
  and mirrored into IPAM as `status="dhcp"` + `auto_from_lease=True` rows
  when the lease IP falls inside a known subnet; the existing lease-
  cleanup sweep handles expiry uniformly. Manual "Sync Leases" button
  on the server detail header for agentless drivers. Beat ticks every
  10 s and the per-run interval is stored in seconds
  (`PlatformSettings.dhcp_pull_leases_interval_seconds`, default 15 s)
  so operators can tune near-real-time IPAM population — Windows
  DHCP has no streaming primitive, so short-interval polling is the
  practical upper bound without putting an agent on the DC.
- ⬜ **Windows DHCP — Path B (WinRM + PowerShell, full CRUD)** — scope
  / reservation / client-class / option CRUD via `Add-DhcpServerv4Scope`,
  `Add-DhcpServerv4Reservation`, etc. Layered on top of Path A in the
  same driver class. Service account must be in `DHCP Administrators`
  rather than `DHCP Users`. Much bigger scope than DNS Path B since
  there's no wire-level admin protocol; every scope field becomes a
  cmdlet call.
- ⬜ IP discovery — ping sweep + ARP scan Celery task; flags `discovered` status; reconciliation report (see `docs/features/IPAM.md §8`)
- ⬜ OUI/vendor lookup — IEEE OUI database loaded into `oui_vendor` table; shown next to MAC addresses (see `docs/features/IPAM.md §12`)
- ⬜ SNMP polling / network device management — ARP table polling for IP discovery (see `docs/features/IPAM.md §13`)
- ✅ **API tokens with auto-expiry** (Phase 1 close-out) — `APIToken`
  model already existed; this session wires the create/list/revoke
  router, extends `get_current_user` to accept `spddi_*` bearer
  tokens alongside JWTs, tracks `last_used_at`, and adds an admin UI
  at `/admin/api-tokens`. Tokens are hashed at rest (SHA-256) and
  shown in plaintext once at creation.
- ✅ **Syslog + event forwarding** — every successful `AuditLog`
  commit is optionally forwarded to an external syslog target
  (RFC 5424 over UDP / TCP) and/or a generic HTTP webhook. Hook is
  a SQLAlchemy `after_commit` session listener in
  `services/audit_forward.py`; delivery is fire-and-forget on a
  dedicated asyncio task so audit writes never block on network I/O.
  Configured in Settings; targets live on `PlatformSettings`
  (single syslog + single webhook for now — multi-target moves to a
  dedicated table when a second customer asks).
- ⬜ **DNS Views — end-to-end split-horizon wiring** — `DNSView`
  model + CRUD ship today, but the BIND9 driver doesn't wrap zones
  in `view { match-clients …; zone { … }; }` blocks and record
  CRUD has no `view_id` assignment UI. The storage side is ready;
  what's missing is driver rendering + record-level view selection
  + UI binding on the record form. Phase 3.
- ⬜ **DHCP state failover (Kea HA)** — peer-level failover
  configuration rendered into Kea's `high-availability` hook,
  heartbeat channel, lease-replication state machine (Normal /
  Communications-Interrupted / Partner-Down / Recover /
  Load-Balancing / Hot-Standby). Requires agent support on both
  peers, a new `DHCPFailoverChannel` model, and UI for peer
  configuration + state-transition actions. Phase 3–4.
- ✅ **Alerts framework (v1)** — `AlertRule` + `AlertEvent` tables;
  evaluator at `services/alerts.py:evaluate_all()` runs from
  `app.tasks.alerts.evaluate_alerts` on a 60 s beat tick. Two rule
  types on launch: `subnet_utilization` (honours
  `PlatformSettings.utilization_max_prefix_*` so PTP / loopback
  subnets can't trip the alarm) and `server_unreachable` (DNS /
  DHCP / any). Delivery reuses the audit-forward syslog + webhook
  send helpers against the platform-level targets; per-rule
  override of targets deferred. Admin UI at `/admin/alerts` with
  live events viewer + "Evaluate now". Email (SMTP) and SNMP trap
  channels are the remaining v2 work — needs SMTP config infra that
  doesn't exist yet, and SNMP is its own dependency footprint.
- ⬜ **IPAM template classes** — reusable stamp templates that
  carry default tags, custom-field values, DNS / DHCP group
  assignments, and optional sub-subnet layouts. Applied to a block
  or subnet on create; existing instances can re-apply to pick up
  template drift. Phase 5 — belongs alongside advanced reporting /
  multi-tenancy, once the base inheritance story is fully bedded
  down.
- ⬜ **ACME / Let's Encrypt — DNS-01 provider for external clients**
  — lets someone running certbot / lego / acme.sh on their own box
  prove control of a FQDN hosted in a SpatiumDDI-managed zone, so
  they can issue public certs (wildcards included) against a DNS
  that SpatiumDDI owns. **Routes writes through our REST API, not
  RFC 2136 to BIND9 directly** — otherwise records land outside the
  control-plane model and get overwritten by the next ConfigBundle
  push.

  Recommended shape: implement an [acme-dns](https://github.com/joohoi/acme-dns)-compatible
  HTTP surface (minimal, widely supported). certbot (`--dns-acme-dns`),
  lego (`ACMEDNSProvider`), and acme.sh all speak the protocol out of
  the box, so no custom plugin to maintain.

  **Data model.** New `ACMEAccount` table: `id`, `subdomain` (a
  UUID that the client CNAMEs `_acme-challenge.<fqdn>` to —
  standard acme-dns delegation pattern; compromised creds can only
  write that one subdomain), `username` + `password_hash` (scrypt),
  `allowed_source_cidrs` (optional IP allowlist), `zone_id` FK to
  `DNSZone`, `last_used_at`, `created_at`. Issued once on
  registration, shown plaintext exactly once (reuse the API-token
  reveal pattern). No "scope" field on `APIToken` — ACME creds are
  a separate auth path with its own protocol, keeping the
  permission surface tidy.

  **Endpoints** (under `/api/v1/acme/`, rate-limited separately):
  - `POST /register` → 201 with `{username, password, fulldomain,
    subdomain, allowlist}`. Superadmin or user with the
    `manage_acme` permission. Creates the `ACMEAccount` row and
    returns the creds.
  - `POST /update` with `X-Api-User` + `X-Api-Key` headers and
    `{subdomain, txt}` body → writes the TXT at
    `<subdomain>.acme.<our-apex>` with a short TTL (60 s). Record
    goes through the normal `_sync_dns_record` path so it's
    visible in IPAM / UI and cleaned up uniformly. **Response
    blocks until the record is confirmed live on the primary**
    (agent ack with new ETag) — otherwise LE polls before the
    record propagates and the challenge fails.
  - `DELETE /update` (or `POST` with empty `txt`) — idempotent
    cleanup; clients call this post-validation. Stale TXT records
    left >24 h get swept by a new janitor Celery task.
  - `GET /accounts` / `DELETE /accounts/{id}` — admin list +
    revocation.

  **Delegation pattern, documented:** users add a `CNAME
  _acme-challenge.foo.example.com → <subdomain>.acme.their-apex.com`
  in their upstream zone, then delegate `acme.their-apex.com` to
  the SpatiumDDI DNS servers. The ACME account can only write under
  that tiny subdomain — a leaked credential can't rewrite the whole
  zone. Walk through this in `docs/features/ACME.md` with a worked
  example.

  **Wildcards.** DNS-01 is the ONLY path LE offers for
  `*.example.com`; most operators asking for ACME want this. Make
  sure docs call out that the TXT on `_acme-challenge.example.com`
  (via the CNAME delegation) also covers wildcard issuance.

  **Audit + rate limit.** Every register / update / delete lands in
  `audit_log` with the account display. Separate rate-limit bucket
  from the main API (a broken cron on a client shouldn't DoS the
  auth-token endpoints). Fail2Ban-style temp-ban on repeated auth
  failures against `/update`.

  **Propagation gotcha.** Our agent long-polls the ConfigBundle +
  ETag — typical tick is sub-second, but `/update` must still block
  until the agent acks the new bundle, otherwise LE polls stale.
  Reuse the existing per-op ack channel (`apply_record_changes`
  already returns async; surface the wait).

  Phase 4 — pairs with the OS appliance / HA deployment story, since
  production SpatiumDDI behind a public apex is the main "I need
  public certs" customer.

- ⬜ **ACME embedded client — certs for SpatiumDDI's own services**
  — *separate from the DNS-01 provider above.* SpatiumDDI runs an
  embedded ACME client (candidate libs: `acme` / `certbot-core`
  from the certbot project, or Go's `acme/autocert` if we ever port
  chunks; Python-native is the fit today) that issues and auto-
  renews certs for:
  - the frontend HTTPS listener (today configured by hand in the
    reverse-proxy layer — appliance deployments need this turn-key);
  - BIND9 DoT / DoH listeners on the DNS agent (when those ship);
  - the Kea control agent TLS (if operators expose it externally);
  - optionally, the API's own TLS when running without an upstream
    proxy (small deployments).

  Uses our **own DNS-01 provider** (the entry above) for the
  challenge — SpatiumDDI becomes its own ACME solver, which is a
  nice dogfooding story. Or HTTP-01 for the frontend HTTPS listener
  if port 80 is reachable. Certs land in a new `Certificate` table
  (`fqdn`, `san_list`, `issued_at`, `expires_at`, `pem`,
  `chain_pem`, `private_key_pem` Fernet-encrypted) and get pushed
  to consuming agents via the same ConfigBundle mechanism the rest
  of the config flows through — so a DoT listener on BIND9 picks up
  a renewed cert without a manual deploy.

  Renewal task: Celery beat every 24 h, renews anything <30 days
  from expiry. Alert rule `certificate_expiring` fires through the
  alerts framework at <14 days (soft) and <3 days (critical) if
  renewal has failed — reuses the framework we just shipped.

  Phase 4 — natural bundle with the OS appliance item (`docs/
  deployment/APPLIANCE.md`) since shipping a self-configuring
  appliance means owning the cert story end-to-end.

- ⬜ **Cloud DNS driver family — Route 53 / Azure DNS / Cisco DNA**
  — each is its own driver module implementing the DNS driver ABC.
  Route 53 via `boto3` is the simplest entry point (stable REST
  API, well-documented record-type mapping). Azure DNS via
  `azure-mgmt-dns`. Cisco DNA is its own adventure — it's an
  enterprise controller, not a DNS service, and its "DNS" touches
  SD-Access rather than the public resolver tree. Phase 4 — pairs
  with the Terraform / Ansible providers already on the roadmap.
