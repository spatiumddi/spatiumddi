# DHCP Feature Specification

## Overview

SpatiumDDI manages DHCP servers as authoritative configuration sources. The IPAM database is the **source of truth** — DHCP server configs are pushed from IPAM, not read from the servers. DHCP servers are configured to report lease events back to SpatiumDDI for real-time IP status tracking and DDNS updates.

Supported backends: **ISC Kea DHCP** (preferred), **ISC DHCP v4** (legacy).

---

## 1. DHCP Server Model

```
DHCPServer
  id, name, description
  driver: enum(kea, isc_dhcp)
  host, port
  credentials (encrypted Fernet)
  roles: [enum(dhcp4, dhcp6)]     -- server can run both
  server_group_id (nullable)      -- logical grouping for HA pairs
  status: enum(online, offline, degraded, syncing)
  last_sync_at, last_health_check_at
  config_cache_path: str          -- local path where agent caches last-good config
```

### DHCP Server Groups

For HA deployments, two DHCP servers can be placed in the same **server group** (Kea uses `HA hook library`; ISC DHCP uses `failover peer`). The SpatiumDDI driver is aware of the HA relationship and pushes config to both.

```
DHCPServerGroup
  id, name
  mode: enum(load-balancing, hot-standby)
  servers: [DHCPServer]          -- exactly 2 for failover/HA
```

---

## 2. DHCP Scopes and Pools

This is the most granular part of the DHCP model. Within a **subnet**, you can define:
- Multiple **pools** with different behaviors (dynamic, reserved, excluded)
- **Static assignments** (fixed IPs by MAC address)
- **Pool-level DHCP options** that override subnet defaults

### Hierarchy

```
Subnet
  └── DHCPScope (one per subnet per DHCP server)
        ├── DHCPPool (one or more dynamic ranges)
        └── DHCPStaticAssignment (zero or many)
```

### DHCPScope Model

```
DHCPScope
  id, server_id, subnet_id
  is_active: bool
  lease_time: int (seconds, default 86400)
  max_lease_time: int
  options: JSONB {               -- scope-level options (override server defaults)
    "routers": ["10.1.2.1"],
    "domain-name-servers": ["10.0.0.53", "10.0.0.54"],
    "domain-name": "internal.example.com",
    "ntp-servers": ["10.0.0.123"],
    "domain-search": ["internal.example.com", "example.com"],
    "tftp-server-name": "10.0.0.10",   -- for PXE
    "bootfile-name": "pxelinux.0",
    "vendor-class-identifier": "...",
    custom_options: { "176": "..." }   -- vendor-specific options by code
  }
  ddns_enabled: bool
  ddns_hostname_policy: enum(client_provided, client_or_generated, always_generate, disabled)
  last_pushed_at: timestamp
```

### DHCPPool Model (Dynamic Ranges)

Each scope can have **multiple pools**, each with its own range and optional class restrictions.

```
DHCPPool
  id, scope_id
  name: str (optional label, e.g., "Workstations", "Printers", "VoIP")
  start_ip: inet
  end_ip: inet
  pool_type: enum(dynamic, excluded, reserved)
    -- dynamic:   IPs handed out to any eligible client
    -- excluded:  range exists in subnet but DHCP will NOT offer these IPs
    -- reserved:  range held for static assignments only (not auto-assigned)
  class_restriction: str (nullable)   -- Kea client class or ISC DHCP "allow" class
  lease_time_override: int (nullable) -- overrides scope lease_time for this pool
  options_override: JSONB (nullable)  -- additional options for this pool only
  utilization_percent: float (computed)
  current_lease_count: int (computed, pulled from server)
```

### Example: Multiple Pools in One Subnet (10.1.2.0/24)

| Pool Name | Range | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Infrastructure | 10.1.2.1–10.1.2.20 | excluded | Gateways, servers — never DHCP |
| Static Only | 10.1.2.21–10.1.2.50 | reserved | Printers with static assignments |
| VoIP Phones | 10.1.2.51–10.1.2.100 | dynamic | Class: VoIP, short lease, option 150 |
| Workstations | 10.1.2.101–10.1.2.200 | dynamic | Standard lease, all defaults |
| Guest WiFi | 10.1.2.201–10.1.2.240 | dynamic | Class: Guest, 2h lease, no internal DNS |
| Management | 10.1.2.241–10.1.2.254 | excluded | Network equipment |

---

## 3. Static DHCP Assignments

Static assignments bind a MAC address (or client identifier) to a specific IP, hostname, and optional per-host options.

```
DHCPStaticAssignment
  id, scope_id
  ip_address: inet              -- must be within subnet
  mac_address: macaddr          -- primary identifier
  client_id: str (nullable)     -- DHCP client identifier (alternative to MAC)
  hostname: str
  description: str
  options_override: JSONB (nullable)  -- host-specific options
  ip_address_id (FK → IPAddress)      -- linked IPAM record
  created_by_user_id, created_at
```

### Static Assignment UI Workflow

1. Navigate to Subnet → DHCP tab → Static Assignments
2. Add: enter MAC, pick IP from the "available" list (respects reserved pool), set hostname
3. Or: click an existing IPAddress row → "Convert to Static DHCP Assignment"
4. On save: IPAM updates IPAddress.status = `static_dhcp`, pushes to DHCP server via driver

### Conflict Detection

Before saving a static assignment:
- Verify IP is not already assigned to another static entry on the same or different scope
- Verify MAC is not already in another static assignment across all scopes
- Verify IP falls within a `reserved` or `dynamic` pool (not `excluded`)

---

## 4. DHCP Client Classes

Client classes let you define rules for how clients are categorized and which pool or options they receive.

```
DHCPClientClass
  id, server_id
  name: str             -- e.g., "VoIPPhones"
  match_expression: str -- Kea expression or ISC DHCP conditional
                        -- e.g., "option[60].hex == 'Cisco7960'"
  description: str
```

Classes are referenced by pool `class_restriction` field. The DHCP driver translates these to server-native syntax.

---

## 5. DHCP Lease Tracking

Leases are **read-only** in SpatiumDDI — they are pulled from the DHCP server, not managed directly.

```
DHCPLease (not persisted long-term — cached in Redis, written to DB for history)
  ip_address, mac_address, hostname
  scope_id, server_id
  starts_at, ends_at, expires_at
  state: enum(active, expired, released, abandoned)
  client_id, user_class
  last_seen_at
```

### Lease Sync Strategy

- **Real-time (preferred)**: Kea `lease_cmds` hook + webhook to SpatiumDDI on lease events
- **Polling fallback**: Celery task pulls lease dump every N minutes via DHCP driver API
- Leases are used to update `IPAddress.status`, `IPAddress.last_seen`, and trigger DDNS

---

## 6. Local Config Caching on DHCP Agents

**Critical resilience requirement**: DHCP servers must continue operating even when SpatiumDDI control plane is unreachable.

### Caching Architecture

Each DHCP server is managed by an **SpatiumDDI Agent** — a lightweight sidecar process running on or near the DHCP server.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│   DHCP Server Host / Container           │
│                                         │
│   ┌─────────────┐    ┌───────────────┐  │
│   │  DHCP daemon │←── │  SpatiumDDI     │  │
│   │  (Kea/ISC)  │    │  Agent        │  │
│   └─────────────┘    │               │  │
│                       │  config cache │  │
│                       │  (local disk) │  │
│                       └──────┬────────┘  │
│                              │ pull/push │
└──────────────────────────────┼───────────┘
                               │
                      ┌────────▼────────┐
                      │  SpatiumDDI API   │
                      │  (control plane)│
                      └─────────────────┘
```

### Agent Behavior

**When control plane is reachable:**
1. Agent polls SpatiumDDI API for config changes every N seconds (configurable, default 30s)
2. On config change: agent validates new config, writes to local cache, applies to DHCP daemon
3. Agent reports lease events back to SpatiumDDI API in real time
4. Agent writes a "last successful sync" timestamp to local disk

**When control plane is unreachable:**
1. Agent detects connectivity failure after 3 consecutive failed polls
2. Agent logs: `"Control plane unreachable — operating from cached config"`
3. Agent continues serving from cached config — **DHCP service is NOT interrupted**
4. Agent retries connectivity every 60 seconds
5. On reconnect: agent reports "gap period" lease events in bulk

### Cache Format

Cached config is stored in a structured JSON file:
```json
{
  "version": "1.4.2",
  "generated_at": "2024-01-15T14:30:00Z",
  "checksum": "sha256:...",
  "scopes": [...],
  "pools": [...],
  "static_assignments": [...],
  "client_classes": [...]
}
```

The DHCP daemon config file (Kea JSON or ISC DHCP `dhcpd.conf`) is generated from this cache. On startup, the agent always checks if the cache is newer than the running daemon config and applies if so.

### Cache Invalidation

- Cache is **never automatically deleted**
- A manual "force resync" is available from the admin UI (`POST /api/v1/dhcp/servers/{id}/sync`)
- Cache version is tracked; SpatiumDDI will reject applying a cache version older than the current DB version

---

## 7. DHCP ↔ IPAM Synchronization

### Push (IPAM → DHCP Server)
Triggered by:
- Scope/pool/static assignment create/update/delete
- Manual "Force Sync" from UI
- Scheduled full sync (default: every 5 minutes)

The push is **diff-based** — only changed objects are sent, not a full config replacement. This prevents unnecessary DHCP server disruption.

### Pull (DHCP Server → IPAM)
Triggered by:
- Lease events (real-time via webhook or Kea hook)
- Scheduled lease dump pull (fallback)
- Manual "Import Leases" from UI

### Reconciliation Report
Available from the admin UI: compares IPAM DB state vs. live DHCP server state and flags:
- IPs in DHCP scope but not in IPAM
- Static assignments in DHCP not in IPAM
- Scopes in DHCP not known to IPAM

---

## 8. Import / Export

### Export (IPAM → file)
- Export all DHCP scopes + pools + static assignments for a server or subnet
- Formats: JSON (native), ISC DHCP config snippet, Kea config JSON

### Import (file → IPAM)
- Import from ISC DHCP `dhcpd.conf` (parse scopes, ranges, hosts)
- Import from Kea JSON config
- Import from CSV (static assignments: IP, MAC, hostname columns)
- Dry-run mode: shows what would be created before committing
- Conflict resolution: skip / overwrite / error on duplicates

---

## 9. DHCP Permissions

| Role | Capability |
|---|---|
| **superadmin** | Full server, scope, pool, static assignment management |
| **admin** (subnet scope) | Manage scopes and static assignments within their subnets |
| **operator** (subnet scope) | Add/modify/delete static assignments; cannot change pool ranges |
| **viewer** | View scopes and leases; no modifications |
