# OS Appliance Deployment Specification

## Overview

SpatiumDDI can be shipped as a **self-contained OS appliance image** — a bootable image where the OS, all services, and the SpatiumDDI application are pre-installed and pre-configured. This allows deployment without any prior OS or container runtime setup: download, boot, configure via web UI, done.

The appliance is **Debian 13 + embedded [k3s](https://k3s.io/)** (a single-binary Kubernetes distribution). SpatiumDDI's container set deploys as k3s HelmChart custom resources — the same umbrella + appliance Helm charts that ship for standalone Kubernetes installs. Operators get a real Kubernetes node without having to install or manage one; release upgrades reconcile through helm-controller, role swaps are single `kubectl label node` calls, and atomic A/B slot upgrades carry both OS and container versions in one unit so they can't drift.

---

## Current architecture (post-#183, 2026-05-17)

The appliance runs **k3s** as its container orchestrator. Pre-#183 it ran `docker-compose` driven from `spatiumddi-firstboot`; that path is gone in every shipped artifact. The historical post-#170 architecture section below documents the docker-compose era for context — it's preserved because most field installs predate #183. For new installs and the current release, start here.

### One-paragraph summary

`spatiumddi-firstboot` writes a HelmChart CR into k3s's auto-deploy directory (`/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/manifests/`). The k3s-bundled helm-controller picks it up + runs `helm install` from a chart tarball baked into the appliance rootfs (`/usr/lib/spatiumddi/charts/`). Three install variants pick which chart + values get rendered:

- **Application** — supervisor + agent-landing nginx. Pairs against a remote control plane via 8-digit pairing code; roles (`dns-bind9` / `dns-powerdns` / `dhcp`) are assigned post-approval from the control plane's `/appliance → Fleet` tab.
- **All-in-One (AIO)** — control plane (api / frontend / worker / beat / migrate / Postgres / Redis) + role pods, all on the same single-node k3s. The umbrella chart deploys the control plane; node labels are baked into k3s's config at install time so DNS + DHCP DaemonSets schedule immediately. No supervisor, no pairing-code dance.
- **Core-only** — control plane only. Remote Application appliances pair against this box.

```

```

### What's bundled in the slot rootfs

mkosi bakes everything the appliance needs to come up fully air-gapped:

- **k3s static binary** (~70 MB) at `/usr/local/bin/k3s`; `kubectl` / `crictl` / `ctr` symlink to it.
- **k3s airgap images** (CoreDNS / local-path / pause / metrics-server) as zst-compressed tarballs at `/var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent/images/*.tar.zst`. k3s auto-imports them into containerd at boot.
- **SpatiumDDI container images** as zst tarballs at `/usr/lib/spatiumddi/images/`. firstboot imports them into k3s containerd via `ctr -n k8s.io images import`. Includes api / frontend / worker / beat / migrate / dns-bind9 / dns-powerdns / dhcp-kea / supervisor / nginx + postgres:16-alpine + redis:7-alpine for AIO / Core variants.
- **Helm chart tarballs** at `/usr/lib/spatiumddi/charts/`. The appliance chart drives Application installs; the umbrella chart drives AIO + Core. Built at release time + signed.
- **bash-completion + `k` alias** for kubectl — operator SSHing in for triage drops straight into a usable shell.

A fresh appliance boot never reaches out to ghcr.io or any external registry. The first time it does is when an operator explicitly applies a new release through `/appliance → OS Versions` or `/appliance → Releases`.

### Two HelmChart CRs

- **`spatium-bootstrap`** — written by `spatiumddi-firstboot` into k3s's auto-deploy directory on every boot. Content depends on install variant (Application / AIO / Core). Owns the always-on resources (supervisor + agent-landing on Application; control plane pods on AIO + Core).
- **`spatiumddi-appliance`** — written by the supervisor on its first successful heartbeat (Application variant only). Deploys the three role DaemonSets (dns-bind9 / dns-powerdns / dhcp-kea). After #183 Phase 10, this release is installed once and never re-PATCHed for role changes — role swaps happen through node labels (`spatium.io/role-<role>=true`); the DaemonSet's matching-nodes semantics mean an unassigned role produces zero pods rather than a Pending one.

### Why k3s

The pre-#183 docker-compose path fought us on three things every operator-facing release ran into:

1. **Role swaps were brittle.** `docker compose down` of one service + `up -d` of another, with a manual `--env-file` dance, no consistent rollback if a step failed midway. Real recovery was always "delete `/var/lib/spatiumddi/.compose-state`, reboot."
2. **No declarative target.** Compose had no notion of "this appliance should always have N pods of kind X running"; the supervisor's drift checker reimplemented this by parsing `docker compose ps` JSON every 5 min.
3. **A/B slot upgrades had to migrate compose state** across slot rootfs swaps. `/var/lib/docker/` was on `/var` (persistent), but the compose file lived on rootfs, so a new slot could carry a different compose schema while old containers still ran against the old.

k3s solves all three: HelmChart CRs as the declarative target, helm-controller as the reconciler, kine (SQLite) as the state store (survives slot swap because `/var/lib/rancher/` is on `/var`). The supervisor becomes a thin controller that PATCHes node labels per role-assignment change — the role pod schedules or terminates as a consequence of the label, not as a consequence of a `docker compose` invocation.

The trade-off: k3s adds ~70 MB to the slot rootfs and a steady ~150 MB RAM footprint for the k3s server process itself. On the 16 GiB disk floor + 2 GiB RAM floor the appliance targets, both are well under budget.

### Appliance management surfaces (k3s-aware)

The `/appliance` section in the SpatiumDDI UI talks to k3s directly via the api pod's mounted ServiceAccount:

- **Pods tab** (`/appliance/containers` API surface, renamed Containers → Pods in the UI). Lists every pod in the spatium namespace via kubeapi `GET /api/v1/namespaces/spatium/pods`. Restart = `DELETE` the pod (owning Deployment / DaemonSet recreates it). Logs = SSE wrapping kubeapi's `?follow=true` pod-log endpoint.
- **TLS cert manager**. Patches the `spatium-appliance-tls` Secret in place via `kubectl patch secret`. Bumps a checksum annotation on the frontend Deployment to trigger a rollout (k8s doesn't auto-roll on Secret changes — the annotation acts as the trigger).
- **Logs & Diagnostics → Self-test**. Five-check battery: external DNS resolution, kubeapi reachability via the ServiceAccount, every spatium pod's health (Running + healthy / Succeeded Jobs OK), informational DHCP + DNS role presence (OK when not assigned).
- **Diagnostic bundle**. Per-pod log tails (last 500 lines via kubeapi) + host logs + system info + redacted env, zipped for support tickets.
- **OS Versions**. Atomic A/B slot upgrades — same machinery as pre-#183 (Phase 8); the slot raw.xz carries a complete rootfs with k3s + baked images + chart tarballs. A slot upgrade is also an effective container upgrade because images are baked.

The api pod's ServiceAccount is namespace-scoped with minimal RBAC: pods + pods/log read, the specific `spatium-appliance-tls` Secret patch, and the frontend Deployment annotation patch. Nothing cluster-wide, nothing destructive.

### From-zero operator flow

1. Boot the ISO → installer wizard asks for **variant** + target disk + hostname + admin + network + timezone (+ pairing code / control-plane URL on Application).
2. Installer partitions (BIOS Boot + ESP + root_A + root_B + var), writes fstab + grub menuentries, runs postinst hardening, reboots.
3. First-boot: `spatiumddi-firstboot` generates `/etc/spatiumddi/.env` with secrets, bakes the self-signed cert, writes the HelmChart bootstrap manifest, starts k3s.
4. k3s comes up + imports baked images + helm-controller installs the bootstrap release. 30-90 s for control plane pods to reach Ready; another 15-30 s for migrate Job to complete schema migrations.
5. Operator browses to `https://<appliance-ip>/`, accepts the self-signed cert, signs in `admin / admin`, sets a real password.
6. (Application variant only) Operator approves the appliance from the control plane's `/appliance → Fleet` tab, picks roles. DaemonSet schedules role pods within ~30 s.

## Post-#170 architecture (2026-05-14, superseded by #183)

The architecture below was reshaped end-to-end by [issue #170](https://github.com/spatiumddi/spatiumddi/issues/170). Three threads converged:

1. **The agent containers do far too much.** `dns-bind9` / `dns-powerdns` / `dhcp-kea` each used to carry their own copy of host-side concerns (slot-state reads, nftables drop-ins, reboot-pending watch, docker-socket-aware logic). Three implementations of the same logic.
2. **The install-time role decision is too early.** Operators picked `dns-agent-bind9` / `dns-agent-powerdns` / `dhcp-agent` at the installer prompt, baked into role-config. Switching meant a reinstall.
3. **No authoritative identity for agents.** A leaked PSK was the only thing standing between a real agent and an attacker registering a rogue one.

The fix:

- **A new `spatium-supervisor` container** runs on every Application appliance. It owns *all* host-side concerns: slot telemetry on heartbeat, slot-upgrade trigger writes, reboot trigger, nftables drop-in rendering, future docker-compose lifecycle on service containers. The DNS / DHCP service containers become pure service workers with no host bind mounts.
- **One generic "Application" install role** replaces `dns-agent-bind9` / `dns-agent-powerdns` / `dhcp-agent`. The installer asks for a control-plane URL + an 8-digit pairing code. Roles are assigned post-approval from the **Fleet** tab on `/appliance`.
- **The installer's role list collapses from 5 to 3**:
  - **Full stack** (was `control`): control plane + bundled BIND9 + Kea (AIO).
  - **Frontend / core** (was `control-only`): control plane only.
  - **Application**: supervisor only; pairs against a remote control plane.
- **Pairing codes** are kind-agnostic (no more `deployment_kind` field) with two flavours: ephemeral (single-use, short expiry) and persistent (multi-claim, optional max_claims, disable/enable, password-gated reveal).
- **Ed25519 identity + mTLS**. The supervisor generates an Ed25519 keypair on first boot, submits the pubkey when claiming a pairing code, and gets an X.509 cert signed by the control plane's internal CA on admin approval. Cert lifetime is 90 days; the supervisor auto-renews. (The mTLS *verifier* middleware lands in a follow-up — the cert pipeline is in place; heartbeat + poll endpoints currently auth via session-token.)
- **Per-role nftables firewall**. The supervisor renders `/etc/nftables.d/spatium-role.nft` every heartbeat with always-open management rules (tcp/22, icmp echo, loopback) + per-role service ports (udp+tcp/53 for DNS, udp/67-68 for DHCP) + an operator-pasted override fragment. `nft -c -f` dry-run before live-swap rejects syntax errors without putting the firewall in a half-rendered state.
- **Baked-in container images**. Every container image needed for any install role is baked into the OS rootfs at release time at `/usr/lib/spatiumddi/images/*.tar.zst`. First boot loads them into the local docker daemon; subsequent boots never reach out to ghcr.io. Air-gapped installs are first-class.
- **A/B slot upgrades and container upgrades are one unit**. A slot upgrade is also a container upgrade — operators can't get out of sync between OS and container versions.

### Fleet management surface

`/appliance` → **Fleet** tab is the primary management surface. Operators see every Application appliance with state (pending / approved), advertised capabilities, assigned roles, deployment kind, slot info, last-seen. A pending row pins at the top with Approve / Reject. A drilldown modal on each approved row carries:

- Identity (hostname, full cert fingerprint, paired-at + paired-from-ip, last-seen).
- **Role assignment** — pick a subset of `dns-bind9` / `dns-powerdns` / `dhcp` / `observer`. DNS engines are mutually exclusive; chips for capabilities the supervisor doesn't advertise dim with a tooltip. DNS / DHCP group dropdowns appear conditionally on the selection.
- **Firewall preview + operator override** — live preview of the role-driven profile (idle / dns-only / dhcp-only / dns-and-dhcp), always-open + per-role port summary, raw-nft textarea for operator overrides.
- **OS & lifecycle** — installed appliance version, running + durable-default slots (with trial-boot chip), last upgrade state, Schedule OS upgrade form, Cancel pending upgrade, Reboot host (with a double-confirm modal requiring an "I understand this will go offline" checkbox).
- **Certificate** — serial, issued/expires timestamps. Re-key + Delete actions on the modal footer.

### Operator Copilot tools (#170 Wave D2)

Four MCP tools surface the fleet to the Operator Copilot (superadmin-gated):

- `find_pending_appliances` — read-only list of pending pairings + advertised capabilities.
- `find_appliance_fleet` — full state across the fleet with filters (state / role / tag key:value).
- `propose_approve_appliance` — apply-gated write proposal. The operator clicks Apply in the chat drawer to actually sign the cert.
- `propose_assign_role` — apply-gated write proposal for role + group assignment.

### Superseded issues

Closed by #170's landings:

- The legacy `dns-agent-bind9` / `dns-agent-powerdns` / `dhcp-agent` installer roles + their per-service slot-state collectors are gone.
- The PSK-based agent registration (`DNS_AGENT_KEY` / `SPATIUM_AGENT_KEY`) is the *legacy* path; new installs go through `/supervisor/register` + admin approval.
- Pre-#170 pairing codes' `deployment_kind` field (per #169 wave 2) is dropped.

## Post-2026.05.14-1 fleet shake-out + Wave E (in-flight on `dev-mzac`)

Field-testing the first Application appliance against a control plane uncovered three bugs and motivated a Wave E watchdog layer. All landed since the `2026.05.14-1` release tag.

### DNS record propagation across all agents in a group

`enqueue_record_op` previously queued one op against `is_primary=True`, and the agent's pending-op shipper gated on the same flag. Under #170 every agent in a DNS group renders its zone as `type master` (independent authoritative copy), so secondaries' on-disk zone files stayed frozen at whatever bundle they received on initial register — record CRUD never propagated. Fixed: one `DNSRecordOp` row per enabled agent-based server in the group; `agent_config.py` ships pending ops to every server regardless of `is_primary`. See [`docs/deployment/DNS_AGENT.md`](DNS_AGENT.md) for the corrected dispatch flow.

### Supervisor → service-container auth key delivery

`/etc/spatiumddi/.env` writes an empty `DNS_AGENT_KEY` at firstboot (the install wizard doesn't know what the control plane's PSK is). Without an explicit key the DNS / DHCP service container would fall back to the deleted-in-Wave-A3 `POST /api/v1/appliance/pair` endpoint and crash-loop. Fixed by extending `SupervisorRoleAssignment` (the heartbeat-response block) to carry `dns_agent_key` / `dhcp_agent_key` — only when the matching role is assigned — and the supervisor writes them into `role-compose.env`. Service containers interpolate `${DNS_AGENT_KEY}` / `${DHCP_AGENT_KEY}` on first boot with zero operator action.

### Docker.sock supplementary-group fix

`su-exec spatium:spatium` (with explicit `:group` suffix) clears supplementary groups, so the unprivileged supervisor user couldn't read `/var/run/docker.sock` (owned `root:103` on Debian). `_docker_image_present` silently returned False for every probe → `can_run_dns_bind9 / can_run_dns_powerdns / can_run_dhcp` all reported as False → role-assignment checkboxes were grayed out in the Fleet UI. Two-line fix in the entrypoint: detect the host docker.sock's gid at startup, ensure a matching `docker` group exists in `/etc/group`, add `spatium` to it, then drop the `:spatium` suffix from `su-exec` so `initgroups()` pulls the new supplementary group. The supervisor image also gained `docker-cli-compose` — without it every `apply_role_assignment` failed with `docker: unknown command: docker compose`.

### Profile → service mapping (DHCP)

`apply_role_assignment` intersected compose *profile* names (`dhcp`) against `SUPERVISED_SERVICES` (`dhcp-kea`), so DHCP role assignments silently no-op'd. Fixed: new `_PROFILE_TO_SERVICE` table — identity for BIND9 + PowerDNS, `dhcp → dhcp-kea` for DHCP. Shared with the new `watchdog.py` module so both code paths agree.

### Docker poll storm reduction

The supervisor was firing 5 `docker` CLI subprocesses per heartbeat (3× `docker images` + 1× `docker compose ps` + 1× `docker compose up -d`). On a 1-CPU appliance VM each subprocess paid ~300 ms of Go-binary startup. Plus the dashboard's `docker ps` poll was hitting a 3 s timeout, killing dockerd mid-response, generating `superfluous response.WriteHeader call from go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/...` log spam, which the dashboard then tailed into its live-log pane (self-feeding loop). Fix:

- **New `agent/supervisor/spatium_supervisor/docker_api.py`** — talks to `/var/run/docker.sock` directly via `http.client.HTTPConnection` over a unix-socket-aware subclass. No fork/exec; ~10 ms per call instead of ~300 ms.
- **5-minute cache** on `_docker_image_present` — image set on an appliance changes only on slot upgrade.
- **Env-file content hash sidecar** (`role-compose.env.hash`) — `apply_role_assignment` skips the `docker compose ps` + `up -d` subprocess pair when the rendered env file's SHA-256 hasn't shifted from the last successful apply. Resets on supervisor restart so a fresh boot always re-applies once.
- **Dashboard `docker_ps`** moved off the CLI to the same direct-socket pattern.

Steady-state: 5 docker calls/min → 0–1.

### Wave E — supervisor watchdog (in-process + external)

Two layers, different blind spots they cover.

**In-process watchdog** (`agent/supervisor/spatium_supervisor/watchdog.py`). Runs inside the supervisor's heartbeat loop every 5 min:

1. Reads the assigned compose profiles from the supervisor's own `role-compose.env`.
2. Maps profile → compose service name via `_PROFILE_TO_SERVICE`.
3. Snapshots running containers via `docker_api.list_running_containers()` — one socket call shared with the heartbeat tier.
4. Per service derives a verdict — `healthy` / `missing` / `unhealthy` / `starting` — from `State` + `Status` engine-API fields. Tracks `since` (first-observed timestamp) in process-local memory.
5. Auto-heal: when one or more services are `missing`, fires `apply_role_assignment` — `docker compose up -d` is idempotent so healthy services no-op, only the missing ones come up.
6. Cached verdict rides on every heartbeat as `role_health`; the backend persists it to a new `appliance.role_health` JSONB column (migration `c4e2b7f81a39`); the Fleet drilldown renders a per-service health table with status chip + `since X ago`.

Cache invalidates on `apply_role_assignment` running (state just changed → re-probe next heartbeat rather than wait 5 min).

**External watchdog** — host-side bash script + systemd timer. Catches the case the in-process watchdog can't: a Python deadlock where the supervisor process is alive (pgrep passes, `restart: unless-stopped` doesn't fire) but the heartbeat loop has wedged.

| Piece | Path | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Liveness marker | `/var/persist/spatium-supervisor/last-loop-at` | Supervisor `touch()`es at the top of every heartbeat-loop iteration |
| Script | `/usr/local/bin/spatiumddi-supervisor-watchdog` | Stats the liveness file; restarts container if mtime > 5 min old; rate-limits to 3 restarts per 30 min |
| Service unit | `/etc/systemd/system/spatiumddi-supervisor-watchdog.service` | Oneshot, runs the script, requires `docker.service` |
| Timer unit | `/etc/systemd/system/spatiumddi-supervisor-watchdog.timer` | Fires 60 s after boot, then every 2 min |
| Rate-limit state | `/var/lib/spatiumddi/release-state/supervisor-watchdog-attempts` | Append-only list of restart timestamps; the script drops entries older than 30 min |
| Alert trigger | `/var/lib/spatiumddi/release-state/supervisor-watchdog-alert` | Written when the restart cap is hit; the in-process watchdog surfaces this as a `Watchdog: Restart cap hit` red chip on the console dashboard |

The script is intentionally `bash` + stdlib (no Python, no docker SDK, no compose CLI) so it survives anything that breaks the supervisor's own runtime stack. Enabled at install time by `mkosi.postinst`.

### Firewall drift detection

Per heartbeat the supervisor compared the live `/etc/nftables.d/spatium-role.nft` body against the desired body — but that only proves the FILE is right, not that the kernel-active ruleset includes those rules (e.g. an operator `nft flush ruleset` during a debugging session, or the master conf's `include` directive stops matching the drop-in path). Every 5 min the supervisor now reads the live ruleset via `nft -j list chain inet filter input`, confirms each expected per-role service port is present, and forces a re-apply if anything's missing. Logs `supervisor.firewall.drift_detected` with the missing tcp/udp port set. `FirewallProfile` now carries `expected_tcp_ports` + `expected_udp_ports` frozensets so the comparison is straightforward.

### Console dashboard polish

The Talos-style console got a wave of usability fixes:

- F9 / Diag chip removed (handler was a no-op).
- Live-log noise filter — Python traceback frames, caret indicators, systemd restart-counter spam dropped before they hit the renderer; `--since` window 10 min → 2 min so crash spam clears 5× faster.
- CPU usage 92 % → 1.4 % — Rich Live had its background `auto_refresh` thread + main loop both rendering at 4 Hz. Fixed with `auto_refresh=False` + main-loop tick 0.25 s → 0.5 s.
- Build line collapses to a single value when `APPLIANCE_VERSION == SPATIUMDDI_VERSION`.
- `slot_a` → `A` in the slot indicator.
- IPv6 SLAAC addresses fold into a `+N IPv6` chip alongside the IPv4 list.
- Agent panel deleted; Control plane URL + Identity status fold into a one-line `Agent http://… Approved ✓` row in the header.
- Vitals + Disks merged into one row.
- Services row gains a ports / network-mode column: `53/tcp 53/udp` for published-port containers, `host net` in bold cyan for DHCP-kea (positive signal — host mode is the expected shape for broadcast-relay reachability).
- Disk dedupe — `/home` / `/root` bind mounts collapse to the underlying `/var` device; `/var/lib/spatiumddi/docker-overlay/lower` hidden as an implementation detail.
- New `Watchdog` header line surfacing the external watchdog state — green `Loop ticking · Ns ago`, yellow `Loop stale · Ns ago`, red `Restart cap hit` when the rate-limit alert trigger is present.
- Services panel unions whichever supervisor-managed service is either in `docker ps` or listed in `role-compose.env`'s `COMPOSE_PROFILES`, so a crashed / removed container surfaces as `(not running)` rather than disappearing entirely.

### Fleet UI updates

- File rename `frontend/src/pages/appliance/ApprovalsTab.tsx` → `FleetTab.tsx` (component + React-Query keys + URL hash all migrated from `approvals` → `fleet`). The original "Approvals" framing predates the full Fleet management surface that now lives in the tab.
- Sidebar regrouped into two sub-headings — **Infrastructure** (Appliances / Pairing codes / Slot images) and **Services** (NTP / SNMP) — so future Wave-E host-config surfaces (#155–#166) drop into Services without restructuring.
- New **Services** column on the Appliances list with per-role chips coloured by `role_switch_state` (green `ready` ✓ / amber `pending` / rose `failed` / neutral `observer`) so operators see at a glance what's actually configured and running on each box.
- **Service health** section in the per-appliance drilldown rendering one row per `role_health` entry — service name · role · status chip · relative `since` (e.g. "3m ago") · short container id.
- **Approve + sign cert** mutation now refreshes the drilldown row on success (was leaving the operator staring at a stale `pending_approval` modal).
- **Role assignment Save** shows a transient `✓ Saved` indicator and re-baselines the `dirty` check against the refreshed row.
- **Slot image Delete** gated behind a `ConfirmModal` (destructive tone, shows version + notes + SHA-256 prefix, loading spinner during the mutation). The previous one-click delete wiped a ~700 MiB cached release on a misclick.

### Misc

- `spatiumddi-firstboot` writes `/etc/spatiumddi/.env` mode 644 (was 600) so the supervisor's unprivileged user can read it through the `/etc/spatiumddi:/etc/spatiumddi-host:ro` bind mount. `service_lifecycle.py` passes the host `.env` as an additional `--env-file` to `docker compose` so service containers' `${SPATIUMDDI_VERSION}` / `${DOCKER_GID}` interpolation resolves without re-emitting every var into the role env.
- Pre-existing CodeQL false positive on `audit_chain_broken` — not relevant here, listed for completeness against the release log.

### Open Wave E follow-ups

- nftables base-config strip — `/etc/nftables.conf` currently has hardcoded DNS / DHCP / HTTP "belt-and-braces" rules from the pre-#170 5-role world; on Application appliances the supervisor's drop-in should be the sole source of truth so the operator can verify role-driven rules are actually being enforced.
- Per-appliance scoped agent keys — current implementation passes the platform-wide global `DNS_AGENT_KEY` / `DHCP_AGENT_KEY`; a per-appliance scoped key would limit blast radius if a supervisor cert ever leaked.
- Host-OS config plane (#155–#166) — APT sources / proxy, syslog forwarder, SSH `authorized_keys`, static routes, etc. The supervisor's existing `ConfigBundle long-poll → trigger-file → host runner` pattern (already used by SNMP / NTP) generalises to the rest.

## 1. Base OS Selection

### Decision (2026-05): Debian for the appliance, Alpine for containers

| Use Case | Base OS | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Container images** (Docker/K8s) | Alpine Linux 3.x | Minimal footprint (~5MB base), musl libc, APK packages, Docker-native |
| **OS appliance** (qcow2 / ISO / cloud) | **Debian 13 "Trixie" (Stable)** | mkosi-supported (Alpine support was dropped from mkosi ≥ 23), broad hardware support, mature installer, glibc, systemd-native |

The earlier "dual-track Alpine + Debian" plan got narrowed once the
build tool was chosen. mkosi 25 (current Debian-trixie package)
dropped Alpine as a supported `Distribution=`, and the alternatives
(`alpine-make-vm-image`, raw `mkimage.sh`) would have meant carrying
two divergent build pipelines for the same artifact set. Debian gives
us one toolchain across qcow2 / ISO / cloud images and aligns with
APPLIANCE.md's pre-existing Option B. The **bundled service
containers stay Alpine-based** — only the appliance host OS shifts.

---

### Option A: Alpine Linux

**Pros:**
- Extremely small base image (~5MB Docker, ~130MB full install)
- `musl libc` — no GNU libc licensing concerns beyond the kernel itself
- `OpenRC` init system (lightweight, no systemd complexity)
- `APK` package manager — fast, reproducible
- Native Docker base image — our container images already use it
- BusyBox userland — familiar to embedded/appliance developers
- All packages and Alpine itself are MIT licensed (tools) + GPL2 (kernel)

**Cons:**
- `musl libc` can cause compatibility issues with some Python C extensions (rare but real)
- Smaller community than Debian/Ubuntu
- `OpenRC` differs from systemd — most guides assume systemd
- Hardware support can lag (kernel version behind Debian)
- ISC Kea and BIND9 packages exist but may be older versions

**Alpine License Note:**
- Alpine Linux itself: MIT license for Alpine-specific tooling
- The Linux kernel: GPL v2 (copyleft — source must be available, but does NOT affect your application code)
- APK packages: each package has its own license (Python: PSF, BIND: MPL 2.0, Kea: MPL 2.0)
- **Your application code is not affected by GPL2** — GPL2 does not extend to user-space applications that merely run on the kernel. It only requires kernel source availability.
- **No legal barrier** to shipping a closed or open-source appliance on Alpine.

---

### Option B: Debian 12 "Bookworm" Stable

**Pros:**
- Widest hardware driver support (NIC drivers, storage controllers, etc.)
- `glibc` — full compatibility with all Python C extensions
- `systemd` — industry standard, best documentation
- `apt` with `stable` channel — predictable, LTS lifecycle
- ISC Kea and BIND9 both have well-maintained `.deb` packages
- Debian itself is 100% free software (DFSG-compliant)

**Cons:**
- Larger footprint (~300MB minimal install vs ~130MB Alpine)
- Slower package updates than Ubuntu
- Docker images are larger than Alpine-based equivalents

**Debian License Note:**
- Debian itself: Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG) — all core packages are open source
- Same kernel GPL2 note as above applies
- `glibc`: LGPL 2.1 — applications linking against it are **not** required to be GPL-licensed (LGPL is designed for this)
- **No legal barriers** to shipping a commercial or open-source appliance on Debian.

---

### Option C: FreeBSD (Considered, Not Recommended for Phase 1)

**Pros:**
- BSD license (2-clause or 3-clause) — maximally permissive
- Excellent networking stack (pf firewall, CARP for HA IPs)
- ZFS built-in
- Ports tree is comprehensive

**Cons:**
- No Linux kernel → Docker images don't run natively (need Linux compat layer or bhyve VMs)
- Python ecosystem has some friction on FreeBSD
- Kea DHCP and some DNS drivers have less testing on FreeBSD
- Smaller pool of operators familiar with FreeBSD vs Linux
- Cannot use existing Linux container images directly
- Significantly more complex appliance build process

**Recommendation:** Defer FreeBSD to a community contribution. It is architecturally possible but adds too much complexity for Phase 1.

## 2. Appliance Image Types

| Format | Tool | Target |
|---|---|---|
| `.iso` (bootable) | `live-build` (Debian) or `mkimage.sh` (Alpine) | Physical servers, VMs with ISO mount |
| `.qcow2` (QEMU/KVM) | `virt-builder` or `mkosi` | KVM, Proxmox, OpenStack |
| `.vmdk` (VMware) | Convert from qcow2 via `qemu-img` | VMware ESXi/vSphere |
| `.ova` (VMware) | `ovftool` wrapping vmdk | VMware vSphere deployment |
| `.vhd` (Hyper-V) | `qemu-img convert` | Microsoft Hyper-V |
| Docker image | Multi-stage `Dockerfile` | Docker / Kubernetes |

---

## 3. Appliance Build Process

### Build tool: `mkosi` (systemd project)

`mkosi` produces reproducible OS images from a declarative config. It handles:
- Base OS package installation
- Service configuration
- First-boot setup scripts
- Image format conversion

### Build runs inside a published builder container

The build's host dependencies (mkosi, qemu-utils, debian-archive-keyring,
grub-pc-bin + grub-efi-amd64-bin, python3-cryptography, …) live inside
`ghcr.io/spatiumddi/appliance-builder:latest`. The only host requirement
for `make appliance` is **Docker with privileged-container support**.
mkosi needs loop devices + namespaces + bind-mounts to bootstrap the
rootfs — same constraint as `packer`, `live-build`, `diskimage-builder`.

The builder image's `Dockerfile` lives at `appliance/builder/Dockerfile`
and republishes via `.github/workflows/build-appliance-builder.yml` on
changes to `appliance/builder/**`.

### Phase 1 (current — landed 2026-05)

```
make appliance
  ↓
docker pull ghcr.io/spatiumddi/appliance-builder:latest
  ↓
docker run --privileged appliance-builder
  → mkosi build → spatiumddi-appliance_0.1.0.raw   (2.1 GiB sparse)
  ↓
qemu-img convert -O qcow2
  → spatiumddi-appliance_0.1.0.qcow2  (~790 MiB)
```

Hybrid BIOS + UEFI boot via grub (`Bootable=yes`, `Bootloader=grub`,
`BiosBootloader=grub`). Same qcow2 boots on default-firmware QEMU/Proxmox
*and* UEFI Hyper-V/AWS/Azure.

### Future build pipeline (Phases 2–5)

```
trigger: tag push (CalVer)
  ↓
1. Reuse the existing image-build workflows
   - ghcr.io/spatiumddi/spatiumddi-api:<calver>
   - ghcr.io/spatiumddi/spatiumddi-frontend:<calver>
   - ghcr.io/spatiumddi/dns-{bind9,powerdns}:<calver>
   - ghcr.io/spatiumddi/dhcp-kea:<calver>
  ↓
2. Build appliance images via the builder container
   - Phase 1: amd64 qcow2 (all-in-one)
   - Phase 2: amd64 ISO installer
   - Phase 3: arm64 qcow2 + Raspberry Pi image
   - Phase 4: role-split (control / dns / dhcp)
   - Phase 5: cloud variants (AWS AMI / Azure VHD / GCP raw)
  ↓
3. Convert formats
   - qcow2 → vmdk, vhd, ova
  ↓
4. Sign images (cosign + GPG)
  ↓
5. Publish to GitHub Releases + object storage (Cloudflare R2)
```

## 4. Appliance First-Boot Setup

> **#183 update.** Sections 4 + 4.1 below describe the pre-#183
> docker-compose flow. Post-#183 the first-boot path runs k3s +
> writes a HelmChart manifest into k3s's auto-deploy directory
> — see [Current architecture](#current-architecture-post-183-2026-05-17)
> above for the authoritative flow. The user-facing wizard +
> cloud-init datasource shapes still apply; only what
> `spatiumddi-firstboot` runs after collecting answers has
> changed.

### Phase 1 (pre-#183, replaced): headless via cloud-init NoCloud

Phase 1 ships with `cloud-init` enabled and the NoCloud datasource
active. Operators drop a CIDATA ISO with `user-data` + `meta-data`,
attach it as a secondary drive, and the appliance configures itself
on first power-on.

The `spatiumddi-firstboot.service` systemd unit runs after
`cloud-final.service`:

1. Generates `/etc/spatiumddi/.env` (POSTGRES_PASSWORD, SECRET_KEY,
   CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY, DNS_AGENT_KEY, DHCP_AGENT_KEY,
   BOOTSTRAP_PAIRING_CODE) on first run only — preserved across
   reboots. ``BOOTSTRAP_PAIRING_CODE`` carries the operator-supplied
   8-digit code from the installer through to the agent containers
   on Phase 6 role-split agent appliances (see §10).
2. **(Pre-#183)** `docker-compose pull` (first run) + `docker-compose up -d`.
   **(Post-#183)** Writes the variant-specific bootstrap HelmChart
   manifest into `/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/manifests/`; k3s's
   helm-controller picks it up + runs `helm install` against the
   baked chart tarball.
3. Polls `http://127.0.0.1:8000/health/live` for up to 5 min.

Default web-UI login is `admin / admin` with `force_password_change=True`.

Recipe + examples: `appliance/cloud-init/README.md` and
`appliance/cloud-init/user-data.example`.

### Future: interactive first-boot wizard (Phase 1.x)

For operators with console access (no cloud-init datasource), an
interactive wizard served on port 80 before TLS is configured:

**Step 1: Network Configuration**
- Interface selection
- DHCP or static IP
- Hostname, DNS, gateway

**Step 2: Admin Account**
- Set superadmin username and password
- Optionally configure TOTP MFA

**Step 3: Database**
- Use built-in PostgreSQL (single-node)
- Or connect to external PostgreSQL (for HA setups)

**Step 4: Optional Services**
- Enable DHCP server on this appliance?
- Enable DNS server on this appliance?

**Step 5: TLS**
- Generate self-signed certificate
- Upload existing certificate + key
- Configure Let's Encrypt (requires public hostname)

**Step 6: Summary + Apply**

After completion, the appliance reboots into normal operation.

---

## 5. Appliance Update Mechanism

Two update paths exist, addressing different operator workflows.
Both are post-#183 k3s-native; the pre-#183 docker-compose flows
they replace are documented in the historical sections above for
reference.

### 5a. Container-stack release recycle (Phase 4c, k3s-rewritten in #183)

For incremental SpatiumDDI releases that don't change the host
OS. The `/appliance` Releases card lists recent GitHub releases;
operator clicks Apply, the api pod writes a trigger file the
host-side `spatiumddi-release-update.path` unit watches, the
runner PATCHes each HelmChart CR's `spec.set.image.tag` with the
new CalVer tag. helm-controller picks up the change and runs
`helm upgrade` against the chart in `/usr/lib/spatiumddi/charts/`
— which pulls images from the local containerd image store (already
loaded from `/usr/lib/spatiumddi/images/*.tar.zst` at firstboot).
Pod rollouts happen with the chart's existing strategies
(RollingUpdate for non-hostNetwork pods; Recreate for frontend
when hostNetwork is on). No host reboot needed. Pre-#183 this
path ran `docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d`; the new
shape is functionally equivalent but declarative — the HelmChart
CR is the source of truth for "what version should this appliance
be running."

### 5b. Phase 8 atomic A/B image upgrades (slot upgrade)

For upgrades that change the host OS (kernel, systemd units,
host packages, partition layout). Phase 8 (issue #138) ships a
dual-slot architecture: every install carves two equal-sized
root partitions (`root_A` + `root_B`) plus a shared `/var`;
the appliance always boots one slot while the other sits idle.
Apply a new slot image, reboot, `/health/live` confirms, grub
auto-commits the swap — or auto-reverts on next reboot if the
new slot didn't come up.

**Partition layout (2026.05.12-1):**

```
p1 BIOS Boot    1 MiB    ef02
p2 ESP        512 MiB    ef00   /boot/efi (FAT32, fmask=0133,dmask=0022)
p3 root_A       4 GiB    8304   active slot (this install)
p4 root_B       4 GiB    8304   inactive slot (staged by slot-upgrade)
p5 var         balance   8300   shared across slots (/var/lib/docker,
                                /var/persist/etc, /var/home, /var/root)
```

Hard floor: 16 GiB target disk.

**/etc overlayfs:** each slot ships an image-baseline `/etc`
at `/usr/lib/etc.image/`. At boot, a systemd `etc.mount` unit
mounts an overlay over `/etc` (lower=image-baseline,
upper=`/var/persist/etc`). All operator edits — fstab, network
config, ssh host keys, user accounts — land in the upper on the
persistent `/var` partition, so they survive a slot swap
verbatim. A `spatium-etc-reconcile` boot step merges system uid
/gid/shadow entries from lower → upper so new system users
introduced by an upgrade don't clobber operator-created ones.

**Slot upgrade flow:**

1. Operator opens the **OS Image** card in `/appliance` →
   Releases. The image-URL field is pre-filled with
   `https://github.com/spatiumddi/spatiumddi/releases/latest/
   download/spatiumddi-appliance-slot-amd64.raw.xz` so a
   first-time operator just clicks Apply.
2. The api container writes a trigger file the host-side
   `spatiumddi-slot-upgrade.path` unit watches.
3. The runner (`/usr/local/bin/spatiumddi-slot-upgrade`)
   invokes `spatium-upgrade-slot apply <url>`:
   - Streams + decompresses the `.raw.xz` to the inactive
     partition via dd.
   - Verifies SHA-256 against the sidecar.
   - Re-stamps the slot filesystem UUID into `/boot/efi/grub/
     grub.cfg` (since the slot raw.xz carries its own UUID
     baked at build time, the menuentry has to be patched).
   - The active slot is never touched.
4. `spatium-upgrade-slot set-next-boot` writes
   `next_entry=slot_b` (one-shot) via grub-reboot.
5. Operator reboots. Grub honours `next_entry`, clears it,
   and falls back to `saved_entry` (the durable default) if
   anything in steps 6-8 fails before they finish.
6. New slot boots. `spatiumddi-firstboot.service` waits for
   `/health/live` to return 200.
7. On health-OK: `grub-set-default <new_slot>` commits the
   swap durably. The next reboot stays on the new slot.
8. On health-fail (kernel panic, initramfs failure, api stack
   broken): no commit happens. Next reboot reverts to the
   previous `saved_entry` automatically. Worst case is one
   wasted reboot.

**CLI access (for emergency / scripted upgrades):**

```bash
# Inspect both slots
spatium-upgrade-slot status

# Apply (URL or local file path)
sudo spatium-upgrade-slot apply \
    https://github.com/.../spatiumddi-appliance-slot-amd64.raw.xz \
    --checksum https://.../spatiumddi-appliance-slot-amd64.sha256

# Arm one-shot next-boot
sudo spatium-upgrade-slot set-next-boot

# Reboot — the swap is automatic
sudo reboot

# Emergency: durably commit without waiting for firstboot
sudo spatium-upgrade-slot commit slot_b

# Refresh /var/lib/spatiumddi/release-state/slot-versions.json
# (called automatically by spatiumddi-firstboot at every boot + at
# the end of every apply; only invoke directly when debugging the
# OS Image card's per-slot version display).
sudo spatium-upgrade-slot sync-versions
```

**Per-slot version visibility (since 2026.05.12-3).** The OS Image
card shows the installed `APPLIANCE_VERSION` under each slot label
and the GRUB boot menu labels carry the version too. Source of
truth is `/var/lib/spatiumddi/release-state/slot-versions.json`,
a `{"slot_a": "<ver>", "slot_b": "<ver>"}` map that
`spatium-upgrade-slot sync-versions` maintains. Active slot reads
its own `/etc/spatiumddi/appliance-release` directly; inactive
slot is probed via a quick read-only mount + read of the same
file. The sidecar refreshes at every boot (`spatiumddi-firstboot`
calls `sync-versions`) and at the end of every successful apply
(`spatium-upgrade-slot apply` also calls it). The grub.cfg
menuentry label is rewritten by `spatium-upgrade-slot apply` via
the `_patch_grub_cfg_slot_label` helper — idempotent across both
the original `(slot A)` form and the already-stamped
`<ver> (slot A)` form. `spatium-install` writes the initial
labels with the install-time `APPLIANCE_VERSION` so both slots
get a consistent stamp at first boot.

**Build-time slot image:** `make appliance-slot-image`
extracts the root partition from the freshly-built appliance
raw, repacks it as a 4 GiB ext4 `spatiumddi-appliance-slot-
amd64.raw.xz` with the kernel + initrd baked in + the image-
baseline fstab + a snapshotted `/usr/lib/etc.image/`. Every
GitHub release attaches the slot image + its SHA-256 sidecar
at versioned + `/latest/` URLs.

### 5c. Phase 8f fleet upgrade orchestration

The Phase 8b/8c machinery covers one appliance at a time —
operator opens that appliance's `/appliance` UI and applies a
slot upgrade. For deployments with multiple agent appliances
(role-split DNS + DHCP boxes registered against a remote control
plane), the **Fleet** tab in the control plane's `/appliance` UI
drives upgrades for all of them from a single screen.

**How it works:**

* Each registered agent (DNS-BIND / DNS-PowerDNS / DHCP) reports
  its slot state on every heartbeat — `deployment_kind`
  (appliance / docker / k8s / unknown), `installed_appliance_version`,
  `current_slot`, `durable_default`, `is_trial_boot`,
  `last_upgrade_state`. The agent introspects via bind-mounted host
  paths the appliance docker-compose drops in (`/etc/spatiumddi-host`,
  `/boot/efi-host/grub/grubenv`, `/var/lib/spatiumddi-host/
  release-state`). On docker / k8s deploys these mounts don't
  exist; slot fields stay NULL and only `deployment_kind` populates.
* Control plane persists everything to `dns_server.*` /
  `dhcp_server.*` columns added in migration `f8b1c20d3e72`.
* Operator opens the **Fleet** tab — one row per agent showing
  kind, deployment, installed version, slot (with `(trial)` suffix
  when current ≠ durable), upgrade-state pill, last-seen, and any
  pending operator-set desired version.
* Clicking **Upgrade** on an appliance row opens a release picker
  (same `applianceReleasesApi.list` source as the per-box UI).
  The picked CalVer tag is written to that agent's
  `desired_appliance_version` + `desired_slot_image_url` columns.
* The agent's next ConfigBundle long-poll picks it up via the new
  `fleet_upgrade` block on the bundle. The agent's
  `slot_state.maybe_fire_fleet_upgrade()` compares `desired` to its
  own installed version; on mismatch it writes the slot-upgrade
  trigger file — the SAME `/var/lib/spatiumddi-host/release-state/
  slot-upgrade-pending` file the per-box `/appliance` UI uses. The
  host-side `spatiumddi-slot-upgrade.path` unit then drives the
  same dd → grub-reboot → /health/live → grub-set-default flow
  documented above.
* Once the agent's next heartbeat reports `installed_appliance_version`
  matching the operator's `desired_appliance_version` (and
  `last_upgrade_state ∈ {done, NULL}`), the server-side handler
  auto-clears both `desired_*` columns. The Fleet view's pending
  chip drops on the next refresh.

**Docker / k8s rows** don't have an A/B partition to dd into, so
the Fleet table renders a **Manual upgrade…** button instead of
Upgrade. That button opens a wide modal with the same release
picker plus a pre-filled copy-paste command:

  ```
  # Docker:
  SPATIUMDDI_VERSION=2026.05.12-2 docker compose pull && \
  SPATIUMDDI_VERSION=2026.05.12-2 docker compose up -d

  # Kubernetes:
  helm upgrade spatiumddi-dns-bind9 \
    oci://ghcr.io/spatiumddi/charts/spatiumddi \
    --set image.tag=2026.05.12-2 \
    --reuse-values
  ```

One-click Copy button. The agent reports the new
`installed_appliance_version` via heartbeat once the container
restarts; the Fleet table updates within ~30 s without further
operator input.

**No SSH from control plane to agent.** Everything flows through
the existing agent → control-plane HTTP poll loop with the agent's
trusted JWT; the operator never gives the control plane SSH
credentials. Same trust model as DNS / DHCP config sync.

**Audit log.** Every Fleet write is audit-logged
(`fleet_schedule_upgrade` / `fleet_clear_upgrade` action) with the
target version + agent ID; failed upgrades surface via the
heartbeat's `last_upgrade_state = "failed"` so the Fleet UI can
render a red state pill without polling per-agent endpoints.

### Future: update channels (Phase 8d, pending)

```
UpdateConfig
  channel: enum(stable, beta, nightly)
  check_interval_hours: int
  auto_apply: bool
  notify_on_update: bool
  update_window: cron expression   -- e.g., "0 2 * * 0" = Sundays at 2am
```

## 6. License Summary for Appliance Shipping

| Component | License | Implications for Shipping |
|---|---|---|
| Linux Kernel | GPL v2 | Must provide kernel source (link to upstream is sufficient) |
| Alpine / Debian OS tools | MIT, GPL v2, LGPL | Source links in docs; no impact on app code |
| glibc (Debian) | LGPL v2.1 | Applications linking it need not be LGPL |
| musl libc (Alpine) | MIT | No copyleft restrictions whatsoever |
| Python | PSF License | Permissive; include copyright notice |
| FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, etc. | MIT / BSD | Include license notices in NOTICE file |
| BIND9 | MPL 2.0 | File-level copyleft; modifications to BIND source must be MPL |
| ISC Kea | MPL 2.0 | Same as BIND9 |
| React, shadcn/ui | MIT | No copyleft restrictions |
| **SpatiumDDI itself** | Apache 2.0 | Permissive; compatible with all above |

### Key Conclusions:
1. You are **not required** to open-source the SpatiumDDI application code due to GPL components — GPL applies to the GPL'd components themselves, not to user-space applications running on top.
2. You **must** include a `NOTICE` file listing all bundled open-source components and their licenses.
3. If you just ship the binary unmodified (which is the plan), you must make the source available — linking to the upstream 4. ISC Kea and BIND9 are MPL 2.0 — same situation: modifications to those files must be MPL, but unmodified shipping just requires source availability (upstream link is fine).

### Required Files in Appliance
- `NOTICE` — lists all bundled components + licenses
- `LICENSES/` directory — full text of each license (GPL2, MPL2, MIT, Apache2, PSF, LGPL2.1)
- `SOURCE_LINKS.txt` — URLs to source for all GPL/LGPL/MPL components

## 7. Appliance Security Hardening

Applied to both Alpine and Debian appliance images:

- Root login disabled (SSH key only, or password with MFA)
- Unnecessary packages removed (`apt autoremove` / `apk del`)
- Unused systemd services / OpenRC services disabled
- `nftables` firewall enabled with minimal ruleset (see System Admin spec)
- ASLR enabled (`/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space = 2`)
- Core dumps disabled
- `/tmp` mounted as `tmpfs` (no-exec, no-suid)
- SSH: `PermitRootLogin no`, `PasswordAuthentication no` (key-only), `Protocol 2`
- All services run as non-root system users (`spatiumddi`, `kea`, `named`)
- AppArmor profiles (Debian) or seccomp profiles (Docker) for service isolation
- CIS Benchmark hardening script applied at image build time
- Image signed with GPG; checksum published

## 8. Environment Variables for Appliance

```bash
OPENIPAM_FIRSTBOOT=true          # Set to false after first-boot wizard completes
OPENIPAM_APPLIANCE_MODE=true     # Enables appliance-specific UI flows
OPENIPAM_UPDATE_CHANNEL=stable
OPENIPAM_LICENSE_ACCEPTED=false  # Must be true to complete first-boot
```

## 10. Joining an agent appliance to a control plane

Phase 6 role-split appliances (``dns-agent-bind9`` / ``dns-agent-powerdns``
/ ``dhcp-agent``) need a control-plane URL + a bootstrap secret on
first boot. The installer wizard offers two methods at the
**Bootstrap method** prompt:

### Pairing code (recommended) — issue #169

The control-plane operator generates a short-lived 8-digit code on
the web UI; the agent's installer prompts for that code instead of
the long ``DNS_AGENT_KEY`` / ``DHCP_AGENT_KEY`` hex string.

1. On the control plane, open **Appliance → Pairing**.
2. Click **New pairing code**, pick the agent kind (DNS / DHCP /
   DNS+DHCP for combined boxes), optionally pre-assign a server
   group, set the expiry (default 15 min, max 1 h), click
   **Generate code**.
3. The 8 digits appear in a large monospace box with a live
   countdown + copy button. Write them down or copy them to a
   second device.
4. On the agent appliance's installer console, pick **Pairing code**
   at the **Bootstrap method** radio, paste/type the 8 digits.
5. The installer validates ``^[0-9]{8}$`` locally (won't accept a
   typo) and writes ``BOOTSTRAP_PAIRING_CODE=<digits>`` to
   ``/etc/spatiumddi/role-config``. ``spatiumddi-firstboot`` copies
   it to ``/etc/spatiumddi/.env`` so docker-compose surfaces it in
   the agent container's environment.
6. On first contact, the agent POSTs
   ``/api/v1/appliance/pair {code, hostname}``; the control plane
   atomically marks the code claimed + returns the real bootstrap
   key. The agent caches the resolved key to
   ``/var/lib/spatium-<dns|dhcp>-agent/bootstrap.key`` (mode 0600)
   so subsequent re-registrations don't need a fresh code.
7. The console dashboard's **Pairing** row (on agent-role
   appliances) shows ``Paired ✓`` (green), ``Pairing in progress…``
   /  ``Registering…`` (yellow), or ``Pair failed — regenerate
   code on control plane`` (red).

Codes are single-use + time-bound. ``deployment_kind="both"`` returns
both DNS + DHCP bootstrap keys in one consume call — useful for a
combined BIND9 + Kea agent box (future ``agent`` install role,
issue #170).

### Bootstrap key (advanced)

For re-installs, air-gapped sites, or cases where a pairing code
expired before the installer reached its prompt. Operator pastes
the long 64-char hex key. Reveal it on the control plane via
**Settings → Security → Agent bootstrap keys** (password
re-confirm + audit row).

### Which to use

| Scenario | Recommended |
|---|---|
| First install of a new agent | Pairing code |
| Re-install / replacement hardware | Bootstrap key |
| Air-gapped site with the key saved out-of-band | Bootstrap key |
| Cloud-init / unattended installs | ``BOOTSTRAP_PAIRING_CODE`` env (cloud-init) or the key |
| Pairing code expired between generation and install | Bootstrap key, or generate a new code |
