"""Deterministic device-fleet identity (docs §3.2 identity generation, §4.5 correlation).

Both the DHCP orchestrator (which leases) and the DNS query-set generator (which
queries names) derive device identity from the SAME deterministic functions here, so
"a device that got a lease then gets queried by name" works *by construction* without
scraping the live zone (§4.5). MACs come from a locally-administered OUI
(``02:00:00:xx:xx:xx``) partitioned so shards never collide.

Note: the *leased IP* is assigned by Kea at runtime and is NOT predictable here — so
the computable forward/PTR query set targets (a) per-device client-hostnames (when
the subnet uses ``client_or_generated``) and (b) PTRs across the known pool ranges.
The IP-derived ``dhcp-<3rd>-<4th>`` names (``always_generate``) are queried by the
orchestrator's own per-device streams at runtime, which know the actual lease.
